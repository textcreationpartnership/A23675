            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For the clearing this Point, take theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> The Judgment Saints ſhould have of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhould be a Judgment of Humility. There ſhould be a Judgment of Charity in relation to others, ſo a Judgment of Humility towards them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: By the Judgment of Charity we think and ſpeak the beſt of others; by the Judgment of Humility the meaneſt of our ſelves, which there is ground to do from the knowledge we have of our own hearts, of our weakneſs, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and we may ſay truly of our ſelves, what <hi>Eliab</hi> ſpake to <hi>David</hi> reproachfully, <hi>I know the pride and naughtineſs of thy Heart.</hi> And this knowledge and experience ſhould keep all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The carriage of one Saint toward another, ſhould be as of an Inferior towards his Superior, ſo far ſhould we be from ſlighting the leaſt, as we are from ſlighting Superiors. Thus we are to underſtand theſe places, <hi>Phi.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Let each man esteem others better then himſelf:</hi> And <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. <hi>In honour preferring one another:</hi> we ſhould ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour others and not our ſelves, let another praiſe and honour thee, and not thine own lips.</p>
               <p>As there are Saints of different Ranks, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their meaſures of Gifts and Graces re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſo thoſe, that have more, ſhould prefer thoſe that have leſs, and carry themſelves as Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors to Superiors. The Men in underſtanding ſhould become as little Children in Humility; And as there are Saints under ſeveral Forms, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96826:11"/> too much at a diſtance, their forms being as a partition-wall between them, ſo it were to be wiſhed, that the Saints of each form would eſteem thoſe of another better then themſelves: And as there are Saints of different degrees in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and worldly Eſtate, there are high and low, rich and poor, ſo the high Saints ſhould account themſelves leſs than the poor Saints; The rich Saints that have the Goodly Apparel ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count themſelves leſs then the leaſt of the poor Saints, which have but the vile Garment and rags. Thus all ſhould carry themſelves with ſuch reſpect to others, as if they were Superiors, and with as much care they do not offend them, as men have, that they do not offend their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. The beſt ſhould account themſelves leſs than the leaſt Saint, in that the beſt ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſervants to the leaſt. Saints ſhould <hi>ſerve one another in Love, Gal.</hi> 5.13. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.26.27: <hi>He that is greateſt ſhould be as the younger: And he that is chief as he that doth ſerve.</hi> Whether is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he that ſerveth, or he that is ſerved? Chriſt himſelf gave a glorious pattern of Humility in this, <hi>I am among you as he that ſerveth,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saints ſhould not excerciſe Lordſhip, but be amongſt other Saints as thoſe that ſerve. Let all Saints then be convinced that it is their Duty to prefer other Saints; they ought to be low and lowly in thought, ſpeech, and behaviour. And conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is not the leaſt Evidence of true Grace, when we can thus account of our ſelves <hi>leſs than the least of the Saints; Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>if we have not charity,</hi> ſo may we alſo ſay, if we have not Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96826:12"/> 
                  <hi>what are we more than the ſounding Braſs, or a tinkling Cymbal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This is the Ornament of a Saint; God's Glory is his highneſs; Humility is the Saints Glory; God's Glory is his loftineſs, Saints Glory is their lowlineſs: <hi>Be cloathed with Humility,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5.

                  </gap>ſt, becauſe the things of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are things of great worth. Riches are things of worth which men eſteem. Now the things of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are of greateſt worth, which gives ground to call him the chiefeſt and altogether lovely. In him are the beſt Treaſures, which ſhould draw the hearts of men to them, and make him moſt worthy to be called that which he ſhall be, <hi>the deſire of all Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96826:12"/>2. Becauſe he hath things of greateſt worth, in greateſt abundance. For as he hath received the Spirit, ſo Riches, and not by meaſure. They are counted Rich that have much of this World's goods; <hi>Christ</hi> is moſt Rich, having the fullneſs of the beſt things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> Why <hi>Unſearchable</hi> Riches? Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may not be found, for <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me Gold, white Raiment,</hi> &amp;c. There is no Angel with a drawn Sword to keep the way of theſe Riches, but every one that thirſts, and covets, may come and partake of them; But they are <hi>unſearchable</hi> or untraceable (as the word imports) in that they are above men's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and beyond what men can ask or think; they cannot be comprehended, prized, loved, deſired, delighted in as they deſerve, but there is cauſe to ſay as the Apoſtle of the love of <hi>Christ, they have length,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which paſſeth knowledge,</hi> and as the ſame Apoſtle, of the decrees of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. <hi>How unſearchable are his Judgments, and his ways past finding out!</hi> So <hi>how unſearchable are the Treaſures of Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>his Riches past finding out;</hi> They are not paſt <hi>finding,</hi> but paſt <hi>finding out;</hi> They are not paſt <hi>knowledge,</hi> but paſt <hi>knowing out,</hi> and as the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>Thoſe that go down into the deep,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>WHat theſe Unſearchable Riches of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are the Riches <hi>of Love and Grace</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which may well be called <hi>Riches,</hi> being of greateſt worth, of more value then the whole World, and alſo being in greateſt abundance; The Sun is not ſo full of Light, the Sea not ſo full of Water, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is of Love and Grace to his Spouſe, to his Redeemed and Sanctified ones, over whom he Reigns; and by the diſplaying the Banner of his Love, Saints may ſee what they have in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to rejoyce in, and live upon, and ſinners and worldlings and ſtrangers from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> may ſee what there is in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to allure them to him.</p>
               <p>Conſider theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is an <hi>abounding Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It abounds beyond <hi>Sin; where ſin abounded Grace did ſuperabound, Rom.</hi> 5.20. that is, the power of Grace to ſave a ſinner, is beyond the power of ſin to deſtroy, and when Grace undertakes this work, ſin ſhall not prevent it. Sin hath the Law for its ſtrength, and that ſays a ſinner muſt dye, but what ſaith <hi>Paul? He loved me and give himſelf for me,</hi> out of love he made his Soul an offering for ſin, and now <hi>who ſhall condemn?</hi> by which it appears that the power of his love to work out Salvation is beyond the power of ſin to Deſtroy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> towards the veſſels of Mercy, did abound beyond <hi>ſelf-love.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> is to love our Neighbour as our ſelves; <hi>Chriſt</hi> did
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96826:13"/> more. When <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid <hi>Maſter pity thy ſelf,</hi> he was ſo great an offence to him, that he calls him <hi>Satan;</hi> He pitied Souls to be ſaved more than his Body, and loved their lives even to his own Death. And if the <hi>Jews</hi> had ground to ſay, when he wept over <hi>Lazarus, behold how he loved him!</hi> much greater cauſe is there to ſay, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for ſinners, <hi>behold how he loved them!</hi> If the ſheding of tears was ſo great a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his love, what was this that he yielded his Blood ſhould be ſhed?</p>
               <p n="3">3. It abounds beyond all the <hi>wants and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Saints:</hi> It is not exhauſted by what he hath done for them or beſtowed on them; as he hath <hi>the Reſidue of the Spirit,</hi> ſo <hi>the Reſidue of Love and Grace,</hi> even the fullneſs of it, ſo as he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no ſuffering too great to undergo for them, ſo no good thing too great to give them, Heaven, a Kingdom, the fullneſs of Joy, Holyneſs, Light and Grace is not too much for his love to beſtow; we cannot have leſs to make us happy, and 'tis not more then his love can make us partakers of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is an <hi>abiding love,</hi> he loves with an everlaſting love, here's a love <hi>not to be quench'd</hi> with many waters, which no floods of either <hi>Human,</hi> or <hi>Diabolical,</hi> or <hi>Divine</hi> wrath could Drown; <hi>Having loved his own he loved them to the end, John</hi> 13.1. that is the finiſhing of that work he had to do for them in the World, and will to the end of his Mediatory work, till he hath brought up all the Saints to <hi>the meaſure of the ſtature of his own fullneſs,</hi> and when his love ſhall have brought him to this glorious end of his work, in perfecting all the Saints, and preſenting them
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96826:14"/> to the Father, who ſhall be all in all, and he ſhall have thus loved them to the end, then he ſhall love them without end. The Saints have then ground to comfort themſelves with the abiding love of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> If the World paſs away, if Riches come to nought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not paſs away; and when there is ſo conſtant a hatred from the World, and ſuch abiding malice againſt the followers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in evil men, and evil Angels, there is an abiding love of <hi>Christ</hi> to comfort them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was once a love <hi>fulfilling the Law,</hi> and now is a love <hi>fufilling the Goſpel,</hi> it was once a love <hi>fulfilling Precepts,</hi> and now is a love <hi>fulfilling Promiſes, Rom.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Love is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of the Law,</hi> ſuch was the love of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> love brought him that was Lord of the Law under the Law, and carried him through it, even to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is love made him ſay, <hi>it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh us to fulfil all righteouſneſs;</hi> and by this there is Reconciliation and Peace with God, and as it was once the fulfilling of the <hi>Law,</hi> ſo now of the <hi>Goſpel: All the Promiſes are yea and Amen in Chriſt's love.</hi> When Saints are unworthy of the good of the Promiſes, the love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> will beſtow it on them. There are Promiſes of <hi>not remembring ſin,</hi> of <hi>giving Grace and Glory, and every good thing,</hi> of <hi>putting the Law in the mind,</hi> of <hi>turning all to good,</hi> of <hi>ſaving out of all troubles,</hi> and love will fullfil them all; the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is the Teſtament and Will of <hi>Christ,</hi> and there muſt be the Death of the Teſtator, that the Will may be of force. Now here we may take notice of this truth, <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed that his will may be of force, and lives again to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96826:14"/> the Executor of his own will, and his love is the fulfilling of it; hence <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſeth to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>I will not leave you Orphans, I will come to you, John</hi> 14.18. <hi>Chriſt</hi> being dead they were Orphans, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but happy were it for many poor Orphans if their Fathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s could come again, and ſet all things right, and ſee that every Child ſhould have his portion; now although this cannot be, yet it was ſo with <hi>Chriſt:</hi> He aroſe from Death, and will be the Executor of his own Will, and hence he is called the <hi>everlaſting Father,</hi> having a Fatherly love and regard to all the Saints, which is everlaſting, and which will perfect that which concerns them; Saints are the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Soul, and <hi>he muſt ſee the travel of his Soul, Iſa.</hi> 53.11. <hi>Rachel</hi> ſaid <hi>give me Children or elſe I dye, Chriſt</hi> ſaid <hi>let me dye that ſo I may have Children, Rachel dyed in travel,</hi> and did not live to ſee of her travel, <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed in his travel with the veſſels of Mercy, and <hi>lives again to ſee of the travel of his Soul:</hi> Every Saint at firſt was a <hi>Benoni,</hi> a Son of <hi>Christ</hi>'s ſorrow, in that he dyed in bringing them forth, but afterwards a <hi>Benjamin,</hi> a Son of his right hand, he being alive for ever more, and is ever ſeeing them to his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and they ſhall ſee him for ever to their ſatisfaction, and living again, he will ſee that they be partakers of that Grace and Glory that he bequeathed to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſuch, that <hi>when it finds not its Object lovely it can and doth make it lovely. Christ</hi> found <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> a ſinful Woman, and ſo not lovely, but made her lovely in converting her; <hi>Paul</hi> was an Enemy to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:96826:15"/> him, his love made him lovely, it made him a Believer, a Saint, a faithful Servant unto him; This is ſet forth in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. <hi>Thou waſt pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in thy Blood, I paſſed by thee, and thy time was the time of love,</hi> and love made them lovely, <hi>I ſpread my skirts over thee,</hi> I waſhed and clothed thee, and decked thee with ornaments, and thy beauty and renown was perfect through my come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs put upon thee; If we have cauſe to ſay as <hi>Iſaiah, wo is me a man of unclean lips;</hi> If we abhor our ſelves and repent, we may take comfort in this, <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth not abhor, but his love doth make us lovely.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The love of <hi>Chriſt turns all evil things to good, life, death, things preſent, things to come, all are yours,</hi> the love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> makes them ſo, and gives an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious and profitable propriety in them, and makes even <hi>Reproaches</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake <hi>Riches, and better then the Treaſures of Egypt, Heb.</hi> 11.26. Riches are things of worth, ſo are Reproaches for <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtles <hi>rejoyced that they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for the name of Chriſt:</hi> And better then Riches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In that God <hi>doth not eſteem any man's wealth, nor him for his wealth's ſake; will he eſteem thy wealth? Job</hi> 36.19. He will eſteem thy Reproaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thy parting with wealth for his ſake.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Better Riches <hi>in regard of better gain by them,</hi> the gain of Grace, Spiritual conſolation, of a Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If ſufferings for <hi>Christ</hi> abound conſolations abound more.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>The love of Chriſt is every thing we need;</hi> this is the Gold that will make us rich, <hi>Money anſwers all things,</hi> but 'tis moſt true concerning the love
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96826:15"/> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28. <hi>That God may be all in all;</hi> ſo he is in himſelf, and by love he is all things to the Saints; <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s love is Grace and Glory, and every good thing; <hi>Jacob</hi> might well ſay to <hi>Eſau, I have all, Gen.</hi> 33.11. So 'tis in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, becauſe God ſaid, <hi>Jacob have I loved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſuch, <hi>that it will make him when glorified ſerve the Saints:</hi> As their Duty is to ſerve one another in love, ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> doth this: he did in his ſtate of humiliation, but how much more to be admired is this, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.37. <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe Servants whom the Lord when he cometh ſhall find watching: verily I ſay unto you, he ſhall gird himſelf, and come forth and ſerve them:</hi> Here we may ſay as the Diſciples (when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>a little while and ye ſhall not ſee me, and then a little while and you ſhall ſee me) we know not what he ſaith;</hi> we are not to underſtand it after a carnal manner: <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſerve his Diſciples at his laſt Supper, he feaſted them with himſelf as Crucified, and with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of his Death; In his Kingdom he ſhall feaſt them with his Glory, and with himſelf as glorified: in that he feaſted them now with ſigns of himſelf, in this with himſelf in ſight, ſhewing all his Riches and Glory to them; <hi>John</hi> 16.14. <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſing the Spirit, ſaid, <hi>he ſhall receive of mine and ſhew it unto you;</hi> this he doth in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a ſinner, ſhewing the Righteouſneſs, Merits, Power, and Wiſdom and Love to his Saints: but when <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſhall appear, then he himſelf ſhall ſhew them all that he is and hath; here is my righteouſneſs, the price and value of my Blood, her's my Love and Grace, her's my Glory: He kept the Paſſover with his Diſciples,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:96826:16"/> feaſting them with the benefits of his Death, in a large upper-room, furniſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heaven is indeed the large upper-room furniſhed; there <hi>Chriſt</hi> is feaſting <hi>the Spirits of juſt men made perfect</hi> with the Glory of his Life; he ſhall ſhew his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry as having the fulneſs of the Godhead in him, as the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth, as a Prince and Saviour, as a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom. <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to his Brethren, <hi>ye ſhall tell my Father of my Glory in Egypt; Chriſt</hi> ſhall, when he appears, tell the Saints of all his Glory in Heaven, and let them ſee and hear <hi>that which Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Hezekiah ſhewed to the Ambaſſadors of the King of Babylon the Houſe of his precious things, and there was nothing of worth which he ſhewed not unto them:</hi> This is the Entertainment that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will give, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What encouragement is this to be found in thoſe duties to which this Promiſe is made? That is, <hi>Seek the Kingdom of God,</hi> give Alms, lay up Treaſures in Heaven, <hi>let your Loins be girt, Lamps burning, be like men wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their Lord!</hi> This is farther ſet forth, <hi>Math.</hi> 26.29. <hi>I will drink no more of the fruit of the Vine until I drink it new with you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is that Wine? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Contraries illuſtrate one another: now in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.10. there is mention of the <hi>Wine of Wrath without mixture,</hi> as the portion of the wicked; on the other ſide, then the Wine of Love without mixture is the portion of the Saints: Pure Wrath is the portion of the Ungodly, pure love the portion of the Godly; Evil without mixture of good is the portion of the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; Good without mixture of Evil ſhall be given to the Saints, Wicked men ſhall not have ſo much
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96826:16"/> as a drop of Water to cool their Tongues: Saints not ſo much as a ſpark of Fire to torment them. Thus we ſee what Riches of Love there are in <hi>Christ,</hi> which we ſhould be careful not to deſpiſe, nor abuſe by indulging our ſelves in any evil way, becauſe we hear of ſuch Riches of Love; If any ſhall turn Grace into Laſciviouſneſs, they may know that there is <hi>fury that ſhall ſmoke against ſuch,</hi> Behold the goodneſs and ſeverity of God, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuch as continue in his goodneſs, but ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to ſuch as abuſe his goodneſs, as who knows the Power of his Love, ſo who knows the Power of his Wrath? His Love is above our Faith, and his Wrath above our Fear. Learn then to love <hi>Christ,</hi> becauſe he loves; to live to him becauſe he loves; pleaſe him, ſerve him, deny our ſelves, take his Yoke, becauſe he loves, and take heed we do not that abominable thing which he hates, take heed of that abominable thing, Covetouſneſs, of that abominable thing, Pride, Lying, Deceit, Hypocriſy, Lukewarmneſs, and remember that he that loves Saints ſo much, hates ſin as much, and he looks that thoſe whom he loves ſhould love him, and hate the thing that is Evil.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p>The words of the Text, are one reaſon laid down of <hi>Paul's</hi> way of Preaching, practiſed by him, in plaineſs of Speech and declaration of the Teſtimony of God concerning <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and him Crucified; becauſe he eſteemed it the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledge to know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the cheif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt piece of ſervice he could perform for to bring honour to God, or procure good to Men, to Preach and to make known <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> and him Crucified.</p>
            <p>They contain a Determination or Reſolution of <hi>Paul,</hi> in the great work he had to do among the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> which he ſets forth,</p>
            <p n="1">1. by way of Negation or Comparative diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteem of the knowledge of other things, <hi>not to know any thing.</hi> I count nothing ſo worthy of my ſtudy or pains to make known, or of your Search, Diligence, or Labour to know.</p>

'tis worth our leaving all to know <hi>Meſſias,</hi> to ſee where he dwelleth, and to abide with him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Jeſus,</hi> becauſe he <hi>ſaves his People from their Sins;</hi> being the <hi>good Shepherd that gives his Life for his Sheep, Joh.</hi> 10.11. The Woman of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> thought <hi>Chriſt</hi> worth the knowing. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.29. becauſe <hi>he had told all things that ſhe had done;</hi> ſhe told this in the City, and they went out to ſee him; but I can tell you greater things; behold a <hi>Jeſus</hi> that will ſave you, if you come to him, from all things that you have wickedly done: will it not be worth your ſtudy and pains to know him? If you ſhould hear of a Phyſician able in

            <p n="4">4. Conſider him in his Offices. And ſo he is</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A King,</hi> all power is given him to ſave his Church, and to ſubdue his Enemies; <hi>he hath power to ſave and deſtroy,</hi> to give Life and to take it away; to raiſe up to Heaven, and to caſt down to Hell: a King full of Might, King of Kings,

Now of all the Perſons in a Kingdom, the People deſires to know the King; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> being the greateſt King, it muſt needs be the moſt excellent Knowledge to know him as ſuch</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As Prophet:</hi> He is <hi>that Prophet,</hi> the Inſpirer of all other Prophets: The Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> apprehended a great deal of Excellency in this, <hi>that</hi> Chriſt <hi>could tell all that ſhe had done:</hi> but he was a Prophet that knew and could make known far greater things; he knew not only what Men had done, and what was in their Hearts, but what God had done; all his works are open to him, becauſe what the Father wrought he wrought; and all that was in the Fathers heart, his eternal ſaving Purpoſes, his Good Will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Men, his Righteous Decrees, <hi>Chriſt</hi> knew all; For he is in the boſom of the Father as Son of God, and knows all things; <hi>he is the word of God,</hi> he is that Prophet to make known to Men the gracious Purpoſes of the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. He is the <hi>Lord which teacheth to Profit, and tells how Men may be ſaved;</hi> he makes known the things belonging to our everlaſting Peace; is not he worth the knowing above all?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:96826:60"/>3. <hi>As Prieſt,</hi> humbling himſelf and becoming obedient to Death, Offering himſelf without Spot to God, to take away Sin by one Sacrifice of himſelf; <hi>he bare our Griefs, and received our Stripes.</hi> He remains ſtill <hi>a merciful high Prieſt</hi> that hath compaſſion on our Infirmities, and knows how to ſuccour them, and all this out of meer Love and free Grace: Now the Knowledge of Love that is moſt ſweet, the knowledge of the greateſt Love is the beſt Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider <hi>the Effects</hi> of this Knowledge; further to ſhew its Excellency: And theſe are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and Peace with God. This Knowledge of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſurpaſſeth all other Knowledge, becauſe this produceth that <hi>Peace which paſſeth all Underſtanding.</hi> It begets Peace in the Underſtanding, quiets it againſt all perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing doubts that ariſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>quieting Affections, Peace, be ſtill; thus this Knowledge begets Peace in the Underſtanding and Will, Affections, a calmed Spirit: a Peace 'tis that ſatisfies; nay 'tis a Peace that more than ſatisfies: <hi>it ſurpaſſeth Knowledge,</hi> it exceeds thoughts, it goes beyond deſires, it paſſes all; and that becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is Prince of Peace; that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:96826:60"/> is, that none hath power to Command, to make Peace, to give Peace to a Sinner: He alone hath power of Life and Death, of forgiving, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Sin: He makes Peace by the Blood of his Croſs; dies to make Peace, that he might ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy Divine Juſtice, that it might not take hold of Sinners. This as Prieſt. <hi>He Preaches Peace. Eph.</hi> 2.17. as in the days of his Fleſh he Preached to the <hi>Jews</hi> the things concerning their Peace. This as Prophet: Then the knowledge of him muſt needs be moſt precious. <hi>How beautiful upon the Mountains, are the feet of him that publiſheth Peace;</hi> i. e. <hi>Miniſters</hi> that Preach Peace, <hi>&amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 52.7. much more beautiful is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Prince of Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as our Peace, is ſaid <hi>to Juſtify, Iſa.</hi> 53.11. Knowledge is not taken for bare Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending Faith, affiance in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is ſet forth under the name of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> becauſe this is neceſſary to faith, the beginning of it, its firſt Act; now then this knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt needs be moſt precious. The knowledge of all the pleaſant and moſt precious Objects in the World will not Juſtify; 'tis not that which can quiet the Soul from trouble at the guilt of the leaſt Sin, when Sin is truly diſcoverd: nay not the knowledge of the Nature and Attributes of God, not contemplative knowledge of the word of God, but only the knowledge of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ſet forth farther the Excellency of this Knowledge in regard of its Effects, conſider, that this alone renders the Knowledge of the higheſt and moſt perfect Object ſweet and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful; that is, of God. 'Tis Death to a Man
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:96826:61"/> to know God out of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> He ſees Everlaſting Righteouſneſs in God to condemn and puniſh; Everlaſting Power to puniſh; and then he cannot ſee God and Live: he will cry out, <hi>wo is me,</hi> as <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> or as the <hi>Jews, let not God ſpeak, leaſt we die:</hi> O what Horror and Dread doth this beget upon the Spirits of Men! but when God comes in <hi>Chriſt</hi> revealing himſelf, reconciling himſelf to Men, becoming their God and Father, then the Soul can take delight in the Knowledge of God: then it can requeſt with <hi>Moſes, I beſeech thee ſhew me thy Glory:</hi> now a Man can never know too much of the Power, Juſtice, and Eternity of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Eternal Life to know God,</hi> this is through the knowledge of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This transformes into the Image of <hi>Christ.</hi> The Heart that knows <hi>Christ</hi> aright will ſtrive to a conformity with him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>beholding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image,</hi> &amp;c. where there is a learning of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there is an endeavour to put off the old Man, <hi>&amp;c. Eph.</hi> 4.21, 22. and is not that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Knowledge which will make you like God, partakers of the Divine Nature?</p>
            <p n="3">3. This makes a Man partaker of Eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is Life Eternal.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. This formally is Eternal Life, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun as ſoon as this is wrought. The firſt Fruits of Knowledge, is the firſt Fruit of Eternal Life.

            <p>For the firſt, you muſt know, that the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is not an outward, earthly, or ſenſual Excellency: we may ſay of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as he doth of his Kingdom, <hi>my Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> the Glory of my Kingdom is not ſuch as the Glory of earthly Kingdoms; the great Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of my Kingdom are of another nature, as Freedom from ſpiritual Slavery, from Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Luſts, Remiſſion of Sins, Right to heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inheritance; Members of the Body of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> ſo we ſay of the Excellency of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 'tis not worldly, ſenſual, 'tis not that which can be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by the Eye of the Body, nor by the Eye of natural Reaſon; 'tis a Divine and Spiritual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency: The Glory of Chriſt is that which he had from all Eternity with the Father; his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, that in him dwells all the fulneſs of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:96826:63"/> Godhead; that by aſſuming Fleſh he comes to be a meet Mediater; that in him is Power to ſave from ſin, Righteouſneſs to Juſtify, Grace to Sanctify, and Merit to Glorify: In a word, that by his blood there is a way into the Holy of the Holies, an <hi>entrance adminiſtred into the Everlasting Kingdom:</hi> that we are begotten again to a lively hope of an Immortal Inheritance. The chiefeſt Excellency of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not that he reſtores Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Peace; All <hi>things are by Chriſt,</hi> there is the Promiſe of that: for theſe outward things <hi>ſhall be added to thoſe that ſeek the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs.</hi> Thoſe that by <hi>Chriſt</hi> are made Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven, ſhall Inherit the Earth too: but that is not <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s chiefeſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt we have, that we may be ſaid to have that Excellency of Knowledge?</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt know <hi>Chriſt</hi> in both his Natures, in all his Offices; <hi>In both his Natures,</hi> that is the Excellency of Knowledge, to know him to be <hi>Immanuel God with us.</hi> If we look on him only as God, we ſhall but know him to be God againſt us; God whoſe Juſtice is offended, and wrath provoked. But look on him as God and Man, then it is <hi>God with us;</hi> ſo <hi>'tis life to know him,</hi> you ſee him then as Mediator, as making Peace, as reconciling God and Man: there is ſweetneſs, there is preciouſneſs in that Knowledge. You muſt know him <hi>in all his Offices,</hi> as Prieſt to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem, as King to Reign, as Prophet to Inſtruct. You muſt thus know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that you may ſee him in the latitude and fulneſs of his Excellency;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:96826:63"/> ſo we ſee him deſcribed <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.6. <hi>A Lamb ſlain,</hi> there a Prieſt, <hi>having ſeven Hornes,</hi> that is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſtrength; and <hi>ſeven Eyes,</hi> thar is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Wiſdom; In conſideration whereof the Saints admire him, and Sing a new Song of praiſe, <hi>v.</hi> 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Know the Terms on which <hi>Chriſt</hi> tenders himſelf to Sinners; he is that <hi>Pearl of greateſt price,</hi> an you muſt ſell all to purchaſe it, you muſt part with your Luſts, part with Eſtates, with Friends; forſake all, to follow him; you muſt know the emptineſs and vanity of theſe things, and that there is ſuch infinite worth in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as that he well deſerves that you ſhould part with all for his ſake: you muſt know that 'tis a bleſſedneſs to be called to ſuffer for <hi>Chriſt's</hi> ſake, that 'tis matter of rejoycing to be accounted worthy to ſuffer ſhame for his Name, then do you ſee the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Chriſt</hi> indeed, when you can account it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Joy to part with all for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſuffer for him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Know him in a way of propriety, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular application, that you may be able to ſay, as the Spouſe, <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his;</hi> as <hi>Thomas, my Lord;</hi> and as <hi>Mary, my Saviour;</hi> All the Excellency of the Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in this Appropiation: If you can ſay that he was a Lamb ſlain for you; if he be your Wiſdom making you wiſe to Salvation, revealing to you the Myſteries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If your King reigning in your Hearts; if his Blood be yours, his Merit, his Spirit, his Fulneſs of Grace your's, that's Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:96826:64"/>4. Be as diligent to know what <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Will is, that you ſhould do for him, as what his good pleaſure is to beſtow on you; Benefit and Duty, Promiſes and Precepts. Labour as well to know the mind of <hi>Chriſt</hi> commanding Duties, as the will of <hi>Chriſt</hi> making Promiſes; Account as the Bleſſings of his Mouth, ſo the Law of his Mouth, <hi>dearer then thouſands of Gold and Silver.</hi> As ſoon as ever <hi>Chriſt</hi> revealed himſelf to <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>I am</hi> Jeſus <hi>whom thou Perſecuteſt, Act.</hi> 9.5. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehended a great worth and Excellency in <hi>Christ,</hi> being <hi>Jeſus</hi> a Saviour; ſo much as might well deſerve that he ſhould offer himſelf a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Praiſe to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo he askes, <hi>what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> I am bent now to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for thee, thou haſt made thy ſelf known as <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and thou ſhalt be my Law-giver; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know thy will, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> that I'll do, that alone I will do; I will know no Voice, no Mind, no Will, but thine: So you muſt know <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Will, and only <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Will, in matters of Religion and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: <hi>My Sheep know my Voice;</hi> They know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in matters of Religion but what is <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Voice. The Voice of Men requiring obedience to their Commands, in matters of Religion, and conformity to their Inſtitutions, and Ordinances. <hi>i. e.</hi> a worſhiping of God in their way, that they know not; they will not practice any thing in matters of Religion unleſs they can ſee the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſtampt on it, and the mind of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Content not your ſelves with Speculative, and Hiſtorical, but labour for Experimental
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:96826:64"/> Knowledge; this is the Excellency of Knowledge; as <hi>Chriſt</hi> knew when Vertue went out from him, ſo labour you to know <hi>Chriſt</hi> feelingly, by receiving Vertue into your Selves from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 'Tis not the Excellency of Knowledge, to be able to talk and diſcourſe of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to hear of him by the hearing of the Ear, but to feel <hi>Chriſt;</hi> this is the excellency of Knowledge. As Sin is truly known when you feel the burden, and groan under the evil of it, and are weary and heavy laden with it; ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> is known, when you experimental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive the power of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in you, the Grace of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Sanctifying you, and the Life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> quickning you; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in your Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as Light and Wiſdom, informing them, in your Wills, ſatisfying them; in your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ruling in and over them.</p>
            <p>We may obſerve <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſing Converſion, by theſe two Phraſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By revealing <hi>Christ</hi> in a Man. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. that is when Men do not only hear a Voice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, this is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but <hi>Christ</hi> is inwardly revealed, and the Soul is convinced, this is <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By forming <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a Man, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. <hi>I travel in birth till</hi> Chriſt <hi>be formed in you,</hi> that is, that he be imbraced by your Faith, and held faſt in your Soul, and your Souls are made to live by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo as that it may appear in your Converſation that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in your Hearts; from both gather, that where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is truly known, he is revealed in a Man; the Soul comes to ſee and to be acquainted with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yea <hi>Chriſt</hi> is known, not only Speculatively but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally; Chriſt <hi>is formed,</hi> the power of

               <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s acts and works in the whole Soul; and when <hi>Chriſt</hi> is thus known, then is there that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Knowledge, ſee <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. where Obſerve three things, wherein the Excellency and Experimentalneſs of this Knowledge appears to be in a Man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is an accounting all things but dung, that a Man ſuffers the loſs of for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> many Men may ſuffer the loſs of Goods for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. A Man will be found truſting in <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone for his Juſtification, he knows no Righteouſneſs, no Merit of his own, no Duties that he will be found in, and plead for his Acceptance with God: he ſees abominableneſs in his beſt Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, Iniquity in his moſt holy things, ſo that cannot render him beloved, but the more abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but he ſees perfect Righteouſneſs in <hi>Christ,</hi> no ſtain, no defect in it, and that his Beauty and Renown may be perfect through his Comelineſs; that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs is a perfect covering for all his Spots and Deformities; which if caſt on him, that then he is ſo perfectly Juſtified that God ſhall not ſee Iniquity in him, and that if it be ſought it ſhall not be found, and that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs is not like that Covering, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 28.20.

               </gap>n it. If the greateſt Sinner can wrap himſelf in this Covering, it will be enough to hide all his Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a knowledge of the Power of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death and Reſurrection; that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p n="6">6. <hi>Your Knowledge must be an affectionate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> A knowledge of the Excellency of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in ſuch a manner, as that your hearts be enflamed with love to him: Knowledge is ſometime put for Love, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.3. or elſe it is to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as taking love to it, as <hi>John</hi> 10.15. <hi>As the Father knoweth me, ſo I know the Father:</hi> that is, <hi>becauſe the Knowledge of God</hi> muſt infer love. <hi>As the Father loves the Son,</hi> as <hi>Beza.</hi> And certainly there is that in <hi>Chriſt</hi> which will beget love if it be rightly known, <hi>John</hi> 10.17. So <hi>the Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me, becauſe I lay down my life.</hi> So if we come to know the love of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in laying down his life; and the unſpeakable good that comes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, we ſhall love him, Cant. 1.3. <hi>therefore the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins love thee,</hi> and Chap. 2.3.4.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>See a neceſſity of attaining this knowledge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which you ſhall never obtain Life and Salvation. This is Life Eternal,</hi> &amp;c. If you want this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you muſt be deſtroyed. Vengeance is to be rendred on all that know not God.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Look not on</hi> Chriſt <hi>after the Fleſh,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Henceforth know we no Man after the Fleſh,</hi> no not <hi>Chriſt. What is it not to know a Man after the Fleſh?</hi> This is <hi>not to regard thoſe Outward and Carnal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, by which a Man gets esteem above others in the World;</hi> as Nobleneſs of Birth, Breeding, Beauty, Honour, Riches; not to prefer him as better before God by theſe. So know not <hi>Chriſt</hi> according to the Fleſh, that is, do not look upon him in his outward condition, in his fleſhly Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, or external meaneſſes; if ſo, <hi>Chriſt</hi> will
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:96826:67"/> either be utterly contemned or eſteemed only according to his Inferiour Excellencies, which will not advance him in your eſteem above other men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Look not on</hi> Chriſt <hi>in his outward meanneſs and lowneſs of his condition,</hi> in reſpect of which there was <hi>no Beauty or comelineſs for which he ſhould he deſired.</hi> In his Birth he was mean, a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Son, as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſaid, this was a ſtumbling block to the <hi>Jews.</hi> What was in him to win their reſpects, or that he ſhould be eſteemed the Redeemer of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> What to perſwade a Man to Worſhip him? What to be a motive and ground for Faith to be fix'd on him? What to perſwade a Man to forſake all to follow him? What to take off the affections from all other objects, and to unite them to him? There is no outward appearance of ſuch tranſcendent Glory and Excellency, to beget a tranſcendency in their eſteem of and affection to him. This is true when <hi>Christ</hi> is known after the Fleſh, when you Judge carnally of him, and look on him only with a worldly Eye. Eſpecially too when men conſider that this is the condition of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, who outwardly for the moſt part are in a mean condition, hated and Perſecuted, and kept under in the World. There is no Excellency in the Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> if he be only known after the Fleſh, therefore you muſt labour to have your underſtanding and your hearts ſpiritualized, refined from all carnal conceits and reſpects: Look on <hi>Chriſt</hi> with a new and ſpiritual Eye, and ſo the Apoſtle adds <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>If any man be in</hi> Chriſt <hi>he is a new creature:</hi> If any Man would know
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:96826:67"/> 
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> aright, and be in him, let him become a new creature; his underſtanding, his heart muſt be new made, of a carnal one it muſt be made ſpiritual, and learn to judge of things in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual way, and to ſee the ſpiritualneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and divine Excellency, through all his carnal and outward appearances: In his natural Birth look through and ſee his Eternal Generation, not to be declared: through his ſwadling cloths ſee him Glorious in his Apparel, deckt with Majeſty and Honour, which the Wiſemen ſaw and fell down and Worſhipped him. In his Humiliation ſee him making way for his Members exaltation; in his becoming mean ſee him labouring to bring many Sons to Glory; working Salvation in his Sufferings; taking away ſin by being Sacrificed, laying a foundation of Eternal Life in his Death, And riſing and aſcending, let your hearts be raiſed after him. Now know him no more after the Fleſh; but conſider him now as highly Exalted, Crowned with Glory and Honour, ſet down on at the Right Hand of the Throne of the Majeſty on high. Have high thoughts of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Highneſs. Have Spiritual and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thoughts of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> anſwerable to his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality and Glory; look on him as King of Righteouſneſs and King of Peace. According to that 2 Cor. 10.5. There muſt be a <hi>caſting down of imaginations, and every high thing,</hi> &amp;c. that is, becauſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s viſible and outward meaneſs and worthleſneſs there be many things in the World that get above <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and have the upper-hand of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> Mens imaginations and reaſonings they are to throw down <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:96826:76"/> of Infinite Love, which in the next <hi>verſe</hi> is called <hi>the Mystery of his Will, according to his good Pleaſure, which he purpoſed in himſelf:</hi> now this Myſtery of his Will, was the Infinite and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Love of the Father, which was the only ground of the gracious Purpoſe and Decree of his, to give his Son to ſuffer Death to make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, to pay the price of Redemption, that ſo as it follows <hi>verſe</hi> 10. <hi>In the diſpenſation of the ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time, he might gather together in one all things in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that is, that by <hi>Chriſt</hi> he might deſtroy the Enmity which was betwixt God and the Elect; betwixt Good Angels and Sinful Men; betwixt Innocent Creatures and Corrupt Man; that ſo a perfect Reconciliation and Union might be made of Men Elect and of Holy Angels under one head, <hi>Chriſt:</hi> This Love of the Father we have mentioned, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believes in him ſhould not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life;</hi> that is to ſuffer Death for the World of the Elect, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9. <hi>In this was manifeſted the Love of God towards us, becauſe God ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live by him,</hi> that by his Death we might live. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Herein God commended his Love,</hi> as if he had ſaid, here is a Myſtery indeed, a glorious Myſtery, a moſt high commendation of Love; in that while we were yet Sinners <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for us. This is a moſt ſweet thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template on in the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> God gave him to die for Sinners; yea for Enemies: this is a Myſtery worth the ſearching into; and in conſidering <hi>Christ</hi> Crucified, this you muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to know.</p>

In this, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> died for thoſe that were dead, to raiſe them to life: What death were they under? A death of Sin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 2. in which Eſtate they lived to themſelves, contrary to the will of God; yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> died that they might live. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.6. <hi>raiſed with</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and made to ſet together in Heavenly Places;</hi> Well might this be a conſtraining love to the Apoſtle. This ſee farther ſet forth. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25, 26. <hi>Husbands love your Wives, as</hi> Chriſt <hi>loved his Church;</hi> How did he love? <hi>He gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanstify and cleanſe it with the waſhing of Water by the word: by waſhing of Water,</hi> that is, in Baptiſm, a Sign and Seal of waſhing by the blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>by the word,</hi> that is, of promiſe of free Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Sanctification to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Faith. This is more plainly expreſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.12. <hi>Jeſus alſo that he might ſanctify the People with his own Blood, ſuffered without the Gate.</hi> Here is Love indeed; <hi>Chriſt</hi> paſſing by, and ſeeing us weltring in Blood, caſt out to the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Perſons, having no lovelineſs, nothing but Spots from the Crown of the Head, &amp;c. and our defe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="1">1. There is a Vertue going upward to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taking away the Guilt of Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How could there be ſuch an Infinite Power in the Blood of <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe it was the Blood of him that was God: the infiniteneſs and worth of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon did derive an infinite worth and value to the Blood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> thereby his Blood became an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite price, proportionable to the guilt of Sin which was Infinite. As Sin becomes of Infinite guilt, from the infiniteneſs of the Object againſt whom it is committed; ſo Sin is an Infinite Evil, becauſe committed againſt God an Infinite Good: on the otherſide, ſatisfaction for an Offence hath its efficacy and worth from the dignity of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſatisfying; ſo ſatisfaction made by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the price of his Blood becomes of infinite value, ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the guilt of Sin becauſe the Perſon whoſe Blood was ſhed was Infinite: You ſee how the Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſuch an Infinite Vertue.</p>
            <p>For the proof of it that there is ſuch a Vertue, ſee it <hi>Zach.</hi> 9.11. <hi>By the Blood of the Covenant I

Now how is this, but by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying the Juſtice of God? paying the price of Redemption unto God, by whom a Sinner was caſt into Priſon, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.20. <hi>This Cup,</hi> that is, the Wine in this Cup <hi>is the New Teſtament,</hi> or New Covenant, that is, a Seal of the Covenant <hi>in my Blood,</hi> that is, which is eſtabliſhed in my Blood, becauſe thereby is the Remiſſion of Sins; and ſo a Perſon comes to have part in that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. In this ſee the Vertue of the Blood of <hi>Christ.</hi> In the Covenant lies all a Chriſtians Happineſs; therein God is engaged to be his God, not to remember Sin any more, but to be his God All ſufficient. Now this is a Covenant in Blood, that is, that is eſtabliſhed and confirmed in the Blood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that ſatisfied Juſtice; therein was a repairing of all that Injury which was done to God by the Sins of the Faithful, ſo Juſtice hath nothing to plead againſt them: and the Riches of Grace which are contained in the New Covenant are revealed to them, and of right do belong to them: So they come to lay claim to the Love of God, and to that Eternal Inheritance prepared by <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>The Vertue of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Blood as looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is double. 1. <hi>Satisfying Justice.</hi> 2. <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing and Meriting Everlaſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is Redemption from Miſery, and the Purchaſing an Inheritance; both theſe are called <hi>Redemption.</hi> Eph. 1.1. <hi>In whom we have Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, the forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi> ver. 14. <hi>until the Redemption;</hi> that is, buying again and putting into actual Poſſeſſion of that Inheritance.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Power and Pollution of Sin.</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>How much more ſhall the Blood of</hi> Chriſt <hi>purge your Conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God.</hi> Which as it notes the purging of the Conſcience in regard of the guilt of dead works, that is dead Services, dead Duties, performed by Men dead in Sin; ſo alſo it implies a purging of the Heart from the power of Sin, as appears by that which follows, <hi>to ſerve the Living God.</hi> From the Blood of <hi>Christ</hi> applied to the Conſcience, a Vertue goes forth to the abating of the ſtrength of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and enabling it to ſerve the living God. This ſee farther. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2. <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein;</hi> That is by Vertue of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death, having therein a Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him the ſtrength of Corruption comes to be abated, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Our old Man is crucified with</hi> Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> How is it that there is ſuch a Vertue in <hi>Christ's</hi> Death, and comes to be conveyed to us.</p>
            <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>The proper and principal cauſe to which this work of mortification of Sin is attributed, is the Spirit.</hi> Rom. 8.13. <hi>If ye through the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and</hi> ver. 2. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life hath made me free,</hi> &amp;c. That is the power and efficatious operation of the Spirit in me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The formal cauſe is our union with</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and planting into him.</hi> For hereby the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Righteouſneſs, Grace, Merit, Life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> becomes ours. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>If we have been planted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="139" facs="tcp:96826:79"/>
            <p>The Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath a Vertue to deſtroy Sin, as it makes way for the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to enter into a Sinner to deſtroy Sin. The Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> opens a way to the Throne of Grace for a Sinner, he hath boldneſs by the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe hereby Juſtice is ſatisfied, and a Sinner is brought into favour with God; and by this taking away of the guilt of Sin, that which did ſeperate betwixt God and us is taken away; that which did hinder the Spirit from entring into a Man is removed, and ſo as by the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> a way is made into Heaven for a Sinner; ſo by it a way is made for the Spirit of God into the Heart to reign and rule there, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a Vertue of the Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> going downward, which draws Believers into a Fellowſhip with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Sufferings. The Death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a cauſe of a double mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 1. <hi>Inward, that is</hi> of Sin. 2. <hi>Outward;</hi> in regard of Sufferings called <hi>Deaths.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor,</hi> 11.23. This is by being planted with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Death: that is to dye to Sin as he died for Sin; and to ſuffer Afflictions and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions with him: <hi>Christ</hi> being the Head, Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his Members, by dying he draws his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers into a conformity with himſelf to ſuffer with him; ſo that <hi>all that will live Godly in</hi> Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <hi>ſhall ſuffer Perſecution:</hi> 'Tis as it were eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to them, their Suffering ariſe from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death. Now although Sufferings in themſelves be bitter, yet conſidering them as ariſing from his Death, whence there is a Vertue that makes us to have Fellowſhip with him in Sufferings; ſo is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96826:80"/> there ſweetneſs in Sufferings: In reſpect of this <hi>Paul</hi> did account all things <hi>Loſs and Dung, ſo he might win</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and be found in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and know the Vertue of</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Reſurrection and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his Sufferings, being made conformable unto his Death. Phil.</hi> 3.10. Becauſe he could look on his Sufferings as having in them Fellowſhip with <hi>Christ</hi>'s Sufferings, as being made conformable to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death.</p>
            <p>Now the comfort and ſweetneſs ariſes from two Grounds.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The cauſe of</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s and his Members Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi> therein they have Fellowſhip and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: 'Twas for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s good works that the <hi>Jews</hi> Perſecuted him; ſo wicked men Perſecute the Saints, becauſe their own works are evil, theirs good: It was becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> preached and proclaimed himſelf to be the Son of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer that he was Perſecuted; ſo becauſe his Members believe in <hi>Chriſt</hi> and obey him as the Son of God and Saviour of the World, becauſe they ſet him up as Lord and King, wicked men oppoſe them: His Accuſation written on the Croſs was, <hi>This is the King of the</hi> Jews; like unto which is yours who follow him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The end of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s and his Members Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are the ſame, therein is a Fellowſhip: <hi>Chriſt was made perfect through Sufferings. Heb.</hi> 2.10. And it as well behoves theſe Sons he brings into Glory, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf to be made perfect through Sufferings. Chriſt <hi>by ſuffering of Death was Crowned with Glory and Honour;</hi> ſo are his Members: <hi>Suffering with him they Reign with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="241" facs="tcp:96826:80"/>2. There is a Vertue in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all his own and his Churches Enemies.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Death the laſt Enemy is overcome by Death. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. <hi>O Death I will be thy Death;</hi> that was by dying. By his Death Believers are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from Death; this is a Myſtery indeed that Death overcomes Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2: <hi>The Devil,</hi> Heb. 2.14. <hi>By Death he overcame him that had the power of Death:</hi> By that he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Devil by which the Devil thought he had overcome him. In overcoming he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. This was by Death, he ranſomed the Elect, payed a price, and riſing again actually put Satan to the worſt.</p>

               <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1. Reproof. 1. <hi>Of thoſe that are Enemies to the Croſs of</hi> Chriſt; And that 1. In Opinion.

            <p>And indeed it is too evident to be ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When men eſteem no more the Preaching of the Croſs,</hi> &amp;c. when that word by which <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified is ſet forth, meets not with Faith to mix with it, with obedient Hearts to ſubmit to it: Certainly they are moſt unworthy of the great benefits of the death of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thoughts of <hi>Christ</hi> crucified.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In Practice;</hi> ſome in a higher degree more open and manifeſt, as thoſe the Apoſtle complains of, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Many walk of whom I tell you weeping</hi> ('tis a moſt ſad thing which pierces a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Heart.) <hi>that they are Enemies to the Croſs of</hi> Chriſt, to <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Exhort. 1. <hi>Be not aſhamed of</hi> Chriſt <hi>Crucified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To Believe in him.</hi> This ſhould be no ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to your Faith to hinder your believing, but
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96826:82"/> the greateſt motive to believe. This is the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis Ratio</hi> of juſtfying Faith; Faith could not be juſtifying if it did not look on <hi>Chriſt</hi> as dying; therefore be not aſhamed of the Croſs of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If <hi>Christ</hi> had not humbled himſelf and became obedient unto Death, we could not have been exalted; 'twas by his Death alone that we could be freed from Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Be not aſhamed to profeſs</hi> Chriſt <hi>Crucified;</hi> to fall down and worſhip <hi>Christ</hi> crucified. <hi>The four Beaſts and twenty four Elders</hi> Rev. 5.8. <hi>fell down before the Lamb,</hi> they conſider him <hi>as a Lamb;</hi> that is as he was crucified; and for this they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him worthy to receive Power, Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 12.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And to ſtir you up to ſuffer, there can be no greater motive than love, and the love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the greateſt Love. <hi>Paul</hi> Preached <hi>Chriſt</hi> Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied among the <hi>Gentiles. Chap.</hi> 3.1. which wrought ſo much upon them, that their Hearts were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily inflamed with love to <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 4.14, 15. That they receive him as an Angel, and were ready to have plucked out their Eyes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how much more ſhould our hearts be inflamed with love to <hi>Chriſt</hi> who was crucified, who laid down his Life? Be content to lay aſide your Honour for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake; he emptied himſelf: Be contented to part with Riches; he became poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Be content to lay down your lives; he was that good Shepherd that laid down his Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in waſhing his Diſciples Feet, he ſa d, <hi>I have given you an Example,</hi> &amp;c. ſo we may ſay of his Death, he gave an Example, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> But how muſt we Suffer that we may have fellowſhip with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and follow him as our Example?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There are ſome things in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, wherein we muſt not imitate him. As he ſuffered to make ſatisfaction to God for the Offences of Men, his Death was a propitiatory Sacrifice, whereby the wrath of God towards Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners was appeaſed. You muſt not think that your Suffering for ſtanding in the Defence of Religion, and the Honour of God, ſhall be available for ſuch an end. To ſuffer Martyrdom for <hi>Chriſt</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:96826:83"/> cannot take away the guilt of the leaſt Sin; your own blood-ſhed in the cauſe of God cannot waſh you from any Sin, this cannot free you from Eternal Puniſhment: As the Apoſtle ſays con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. <hi>Though I give my Body to be burned and have not Charity, it profiteh me nothing;</hi> ſo it profiteth nothing as touching the taking away of Sin, freeing from Condemnation for Sin, appeaſing Wrath or ſatisfying Divine Juſtice, that you ſuffer the loſs of all things even of Life it ſelf in ſtanding for the Honour of God. You muſt not think that this doth merit the leaſt degree of Glory: If there be different degrees of Glory, that thoſe that ſuffer moſt, and do moſt for God, have moſt Glory; yet this is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis merited, but becauſe God freely beſtows more on one then on another; however the thing is not certain but controverted; ſo that in this <hi>Chris;t</hi> is not to be imitated, we muſt not make our Sufferings our Saviours: <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death cuts off ſuch a Fellowſhip; and this were a great injury done to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to think our Sufferings available to ſatisfy for our Sin, or merit favour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some things there are in his Sufferings imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for us, wherein we muſt have Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Cauſe. 2. Mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before his Sufferings, and patience under Suffering.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Cauſe:</hi> therein have Fellowſhip with him, and herein I mean the Cauſe why the <hi>Jews</hi> did put him to death, and not the reaſon and cauſe why God did deliver him to death; for in
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96826:83"/> that we have not fellowſhip with him; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why God gave his natural Son to ſuffer, and why he calls his adopted Son to ſuffer, are not the ſame for the main: As <hi>Chriſt</hi> was given to be a ſurety for Sin, not the Adopted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but for the exerciſe of their Graces, for the trial of Faith and Love, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the purging of the filth of Sin out of the Nature, not the guilt of Sin from the Perſon; yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> died to give teſtimony to that great Truth, <hi>that he was the Son of God,</hi> and the Saviour of the World; ſo the ſufferings of the Saints are to give teſtimony to the Truth: but when I ſay we muſt have fellowſhip with <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Cauſe, I mean in reſpect of Men that were the Inſtruments of his Death; 'twas becauſe he did all things well, <hi>he made both the Deaf to hear,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe he <hi>came to destroy the works of the Devil,</hi> and laboured to turn Men from their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe he Preached himfelf to be the Son of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that Men ought to come to him that they might have life, becauſe <hi>he ſaid that God was his Father, making himſelf equal with God,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> ſought to kill him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.18. becauſe he went about continually to do good, therefore the <hi>Jews</hi> ſought continually to do him miſchief, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.32. <hi>Many good works have I ſhewed you from my Father, for which of theſe do you ſtone me? Chriſt</hi>'s queſtion implies an affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that it was for ſome of theſe that they did ſtone him; but the main cauſe of all was, that he <hi>preached himſelf the King of the Jews;</hi> that was the queſtion <hi>Pilate</hi> asked of him, <hi>Math.</hi> 27.11. and was his accuſation <hi>ver.</hi> 37. this did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96826:84"/> the wicked World, this provoked the Red Dragon to muſter up his forces againſt him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now be ready to ſuffer for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake, and ſee that we give the Enemies of <hi>Chriſt</hi> no other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak evil of us, or do evil againſt us but ſuch as <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave them; take him for our pattern, believe in <hi>Chriſt</hi> with our Hearts as the Son of God, and confeſs him with our Mouths, let it be our care continually to go about doing good, to hold forth the Truth and Honour of <hi>Christ;</hi> eſpecially acknowledge him as King, and plead for his Power and Prerogative; this is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, this is cried down by Men's words, this is practiſed down by their deeds, let it be our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to ſet up <hi>Chriſt</hi> as King; for this the People of God are now and ſhall be perſecuted; hence comes Wars and Fightings among us; becauſe ſome will not have <hi>Chriſt</hi> to reign; now let us be zealous in this cauſe, be content to ſuffer any thing, in contending to ſet up <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Throne. <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſuffered that he might be crowned with Glory and Honour, therefore let us ſuffer any thing, ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be crowned among us with Glory and Honour, ſo he may rule in our Land, and be the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. Have the <hi>ſame mind in ſuffering</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> had.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be not high minded: the high minded man will not ſtoop to ſuffer; if <hi>Chriſt</hi> had been high minded he had never been Crucified; ſo if you
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96826:84"/> mind high things, your own Honour and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if you ſeek great things to your ſelves, and worldly advantage, you will not ſuffer with <hi>Chriſt. Chriſt</hi> was humble and lowly in his mind, before he was caſt into a ſtate of Humiliation; inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before outwardly; in mind before in body, then was brought low by ſufferings; now faith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.5. <hi>Let the ſame mind be in you as in</hi> Chriſt, be ſo far from thinking your ſelves too good as not worthy to ſuffer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Be contented to deſcend from the heights you are in, to lay aſide Honour, to become of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to empty your ſelves of your Eſtates, and become obedient to the Death, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> lead you thereto, to give teſtimony to his Truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let there be a willingneſs before hand to endure the Croſs, as <hi>Christ</hi> was: <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave them power againſt him, that had no power but what was given; he delivered himſelf up into their hands, and went up to the Paſſover, that the <hi>Jews</hi> might have opportunity to take him; <hi>he laid down his Life,</hi> which notes his willingneſs to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: herein we ſhould be like him, be willing to ſuffer for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> count it your Joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is that our Saviour requires when he ſays <hi>take up the Croſs;</hi> take it up in the thoughts of it, prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for it, and willingneſs to undergo it: God loves a cheerful giver and cheerful ſufferer: as God accepts the will for the deed, but not the deed where there is no will; ſo God accepts wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs in ſuffering, not ſuffering without willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; if you ſuffer unwillingly in a good cauſe, then you <hi>ſuffer as evil doers;</hi> the go heavily to

            <p n="3">3.

            <p n="1">1. He did no Sin to deſerve ſuffering; of that ſtep you heard before.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p n="2">2. Do what <hi>Chriſt</hi> enjoyns <hi>in Spirit and Truth,</hi> not feignedly but in truth, not outwardly and bodily only, but ſpiritually; let the Service we perform be a work of our Spirits; pray with the Spirit, hear with the Spirit; and when you receive the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, It muſt be done with the Spirit; and the work of the Spirit amidſt all theſe Services, is eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial in a work of Faith, laying hold on what <hi>Chriſt</hi> promiſes, and conveys in and by his Ordinances; that Grace, Life, and Strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3.

                  <p>For this cauſe alſo thank we GOD without ceaſing, becauſe when ye received the word of God which you heard of us, ye received it not as the word of Men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God, which effectually worketh alſo in you that believe.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this Chapter you may obſerve two things. 1. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Relation of the Story of his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> which for the manner was done with boldneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and in ſincerity, not in guile, <hi>v.</hi> 3. not out of covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>v.</hi> 5. but his ſincerity appeared in two things. 1. Becauſe his aim was to pleaſe God, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>as pleaſing God.</hi> A ſervice is never pleaſing to God, unleſs it be our aim and deſire above all
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:96826:89"/> to pleaſe him. 2. In his moſt <hi>affectionate deſire of the</hi> Theſſalonians, 7.8. that is, that they might be won to <hi>Chriſt</hi> and be ſaved. Aiming at pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and a deſire to win Souls to God, are always joyned together. Remember theſe two marks of ſincerity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſucceſs of his Preaching the Goſpel, the good it wrought, for which he bleſſes God.</p>
            <p>In the Text obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Apoſtles Thankfulneſs and Praiſe offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up unto God: He doth not Sacrifice to his own Net, but caſts in his Net to catch Souls for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and bleſſes God for what is done by him. The work is only God's, to make his word effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and all the Glory muſt be his. <hi>For this cauſe thank we God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The matter of his Thankſgiving, and the ground of his praiſe. <hi>Becauſe when ye received the word of God, ye received as 'twas in Truth,</hi> i. e. as it ought to be received. And therein obſerve further.</p>
            <p n="1">1, The Divine Authority of the word aſſerted, <hi>As it is in Truth the word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The manner how it muſt be received by men: <hi>As the word of God himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The way in which it comes to work effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; that is, <hi>by believing it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct. The word contained in the Books of the Old and New Teſtament, is in Truth the word of God:</hi> This is the firſt Stone that muſt be layed when you begin the work of ſaving your Souls; this is the Foundation of Religion; our Faith, our Hope, our Profeſſion of Religion is all vain, unleſs this Principle be rooted in our Hearts, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.12.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:96826:89"/> I may ſay of ſome of you as the Apoſtle of ſome of them, <hi>Ye have need that one teach you which be the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God.</hi> Now this is one of the firſt of thoſe firſt Principles: which that you may be inſtructed in. Four Truths are to be ſhewn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Truth</hi> 1. <hi>That word which is held forth as God's, is ſo in Truth.</hi> It hath God for its Author. And if you ask as <hi>Chriſt</hi> concerning the Coin, <hi>whoſe Image and Superſcription hath it,</hi> the Anſwer is, <hi>God</hi>'s, give then to God the things that are God's. You muſt not come with the Devil's Queſtion, no not in your hearts, <hi>yea, hath God ſaid it?</hi> But be like the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> here, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there is a God that made the World and and all Creatures, I hope is certain to you; and that this God is to be worſhipped: There was a Law written in man's heart, which did teach him how God was to be worſhipped: but Sin hath almoſt blotted out this Law, ſo that there remains but here and there a Character of it, and impoſſible it is that thereby we ſhould come to a ſaving knowledge of the mind of God. 'Tis with us in reſpect of the things of God as with the Blind Man, <hi>Mar.</hi> 8.24. <hi>Christ</hi> put his hands upon him and <hi>askt if he ſaw ought: I ſee Men at Trees walking:</hi> So we in our natural condition, we ſee God as Man, and as Trees, and ſo fall to ſuch groſs Idolatries to worſhip ſtocks: we look on evil as good, on good as evil. Now as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did put his hands the ſecond time on the Blind Man, and then he ſaw clearly; ſo God muſt give his Law the ſecond time, and give us Eyes the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and reſtore a divine and ſpiritual Light
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:96826:90"/> to us; then we ſhall ſee the things of God clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The former of theſe he hath done, he leſt his will upon Record, in the word, which in truth is his. The latter we muſt deſire him to do, if he hath not done it already; and as a means to further this, I ſhall endeavour to prove it to you. And here take Notice of three things as neceſſary to eſtabliſh you in this Truth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is the Spirit in Scripture giving Teſtimony to it,</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſays, <hi>Though I bear witneſs of my ſelf, it is true, John</hi> 8.14. So the Spirit in Scripture giving witneſs to it ſelf, is true, <hi>John</hi> 3:33, 34. Faith receives that Teſtimony, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>All Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ipture,</hi> &amp;c. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Holy Men ſpeak,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Truth</hi> 2. There are <hi>Arguments to be drawn from the word it ſelf to Evidence the Divine Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As 1. <hi>The Power and Efficacy of the word.</hi> The word is quick and powerful, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 4.12. There is a twofold word of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is the <hi>Eternally begotten word of God,</hi> that is, the Second Perſon, <hi>John</hi> 1.1. this is moſt Powerful, Omnipotent; becauſe he is God: All the great works of God were done by this word, <hi>v.</hi> 3. All things were made by him. He is called the <hi>Word,</hi> becauſe begotten of the Divine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding beholding the Divine Eſſence: And as a word doth expreſs, and is the Image, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the mind, ſo <hi>the Son is the expreſs Image of the Father.</hi> Now ſome underſtand that place of this word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is the written word of God, which may be called <hi>the word of the word of God. Chriſt</hi> is the word of the Father. This is the word of <hi>Chriſt, Col.</hi> 3.16. He is the great Prophet that
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96826:90"/> revealed this word. Now as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called the <hi>Power of God,</hi> becauſe by him all things were made, ſo this word is the power of <hi>Christ;</hi> 'tis a powerful Inſtrument in his hand, whereby he doth all great works, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. deſtroying <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>'s Kingdom, and ſetting up his own Kingdom, converting Souls, <hi>&amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and in this reſpect 'tis ſaid to be quick and powerful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by this power <hi>Chriſt</hi> overcame the Devil, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.4, 7. <hi>'Its written;</hi> now the power of the word is ſeen.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In conviction of the Conſcience,</hi> a wing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining mens Spirits: How many proud Hearts have been made to ſtoop and fall down before the power of the word, and to ſtand trembling before it, as <hi>Act.</hi> 24.25. Felix <hi>trembled and ſaid go thy way for this time,</hi> &amp;c. he could not ſtand before the power of the word; and experience tells us what a power the word hath in awakning ſleepy Conſciences, in pricking Men at the Heart, that they know not what to do: in wounding Mens Spirits in ſuch a manner, as that the wiſe man ſays of it, <hi>a wounded Spirit who can bear?</hi> ſo as that the moſt exquiſite torments of the body are not to be compared with it; the ſcorching of Fire, the dividing betwixt the Joynts and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, yea Death it ſelf is nothing to it: for would not a wounded Conſcience chooſe Death to be freed from the torment thereof? what a power is it that the word hath? when Men have gone on in Sin and taken great pleaſure in it, and when they hear what the word ſays, that ſuch muſt be damned, baniſh'd from the preſence of God, and be everlaſtingly tormented with Devils; and that this that the word ſpeaks, ſhould ſtrike ſuch
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96826:91"/> unſpeakable terror to the Heart of Man; what doth this argue but that the word is powerful? <hi>Joh</hi> 18.6. as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſpake but a word, and his Enemies that came to take him fell back; ſo that Mens proud and ſtubborn hearts ſhould fall down before the word, and are made to ſay as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils <hi>why art thou come to torment us?</hi> this ſhews that there is an Almighty God ſpeaking in the word: and this f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

'Tis drawn from the <hi>Holineſs of the Word:</hi> Holineſs conſiſts in a conformity to the will of God, and giving Glory to him: This is a Principle ingrafted in Man's heart, <hi>That God is to be worſhipped, and that all Glory muſt be given to him, and that his Will is the Supreme Law:</hi> now in the word is the will of God perfectly revealed. The Moral Law requires that which none can deny, but 'tis moſt juſt and equal that it ſhould be done. In the Law of Nature we Sinners could
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96826:93"/> never have read the will of God; but he having given the Moral Law which is nothing but the Law of Nature; ſo much is leſt of the Law of Nature, that there is none but in their Judgments muſt needs be convinced, that we are bound in Conſcience to obey it: ſo that the word gives us a perfect rule of Holineſs, it ſhews what God is, it advances him infinitly above all things; which we muſt ſet to our Seals ſhould be ſo: it ſays he is God, and there's none beſides him; that of him are all things; that he is the chief good, and our happineſs ſtands in enjoying him, and in his favour is our life. And it ſhews that he muſt be worſhipped with our whole ſelves, Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; that it is the worſhip of the Heart and Spirit he ſpecially requires, <hi>i. e.</hi> that we fear him and love him, and put our truſt in him: it ſhews the vanity of the Creature, and infinite perfection of God; it diſcovers the Evil of Sin, and the Beauty of Holineſs, 'tis a Creature-emptying, and God-advancing word: Whereas in other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Religions beſides the word, 'tis other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; as in Popery and Popiſh Traditions; there is much Ceremony but little Subſtance; outward, pompous and bodily ſervice, little or none of the heart: The honour that is due to God, is given to Saints; Idols are worſhipped inſtead of God. And in the <hi>Turkiſh Alcoran,</hi> happineſs is placed in outward pleaſures and carnal delights. Now it is far otherwiſe in the Scriptures; In a word, theſe three things well weighed, if we can judge of any thing in matters of Religion, <hi>viz. That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtill gives all Glory to God,</hi> and <hi>places all Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in God,</hi> and that it ſets forth conformity to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:96826:94"/> God, and communion with God as our perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and alſo ſhews an exact way for attaining to both; the Law as a rule for conformity, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the way to communion with God; theſe things being ſeriouſly conſidered by us, would amount to a demonſtrative and moſt convincing Argument, <hi>That this is the very word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> This may ſhew us that if we would be Holy we muſt look to the word, and take that for our rule. If we would Glorify God, and be Glorified by God, Study the word, and if we would worſhip God aright we muſt take the word for our rule: Evermore <hi>to the Law and Teſtimony, Iſa.</hi> 8.20. if you ſpeak not, and walk not according to this rule, 'tis becauſe there is no light in you. If the Cuſtom and Tradition of men prevail more then the word, 'tis becauſe you are ignorant of the holineſs and perfection of the word.</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96826:97"/> from God to be taught; <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.45. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8.10. we know God did inable Children to ſing <hi>Hoſanna</hi> to <hi>Chriſt, Math.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.4. The heart of the raſh inconſiderate Men ſhall underſtand know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the Tongue of the Stammerer ſhall be ready to ſpeak plainly; <hi>they ſhall be all taught of God</hi> that are willing to learn of God; and the Spirit that leads into all truth is a Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> firſt. Reproof of two ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Thoſe that receive not the word of God with ſo much reſpect as the word of Man:</hi> And it is to be obſerved for the moſt part, that if the word be not received with the reſpect that is due to the word of God, then it is received with leſs reſpect than is due to the word of Man. If the word be not embraced as God's, 'tis deſpiſed more than Man's. If Men love it not above any word, they hate it more than any word; and what's the reaſon?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is a great Enemy to what Men do naturally love as their own Souls. If they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not the word ſo as above all to deſire to yield obedience to it, then they hate it; for it reproves for an <hi>Herodias,</hi> it forbids that which is Mens great delight to follow; it contemns the World, and it condemns Sinners: Hence if the word be not embraced as the word of God, with that Fear, and Reverence that is due to it, 'tis hated and deſpiſed more than the word of Man. Thus 'tis with all thoſe that take delight in Sin, and greedily hunt after the things of the World, and care for nothing but to ſatisfy their own Luſts and deſires; they can't but hate the Light
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:96826:98"/> becauſe their deeds are evil. There is hardly a <hi>medium</hi> betwixt theſe two, a receiving of, and ſubmitting to the whole word as God's, and a hatred of it in ſome parts at leaſt: every Sinner hath ſuch a diſpoſition to the word, as <hi>Ahab</hi> to <hi>Michaiah, I hate him becauſe he Prophecies not good to me;</hi> ſo the word gives not a tolleration to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Sin, which is only good in a natural Man's Eye, and therefore 'tis hated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Pride is another reaſon: That which is generally condemned to be the Devil's firſt Sin, is our great Sin, <hi>Pride;</hi> the Devil thought himſelf too high to ſubmit, ſo he rebelled againſt God; that he might Rule, he'll uphold and maintain a Kingdom againſt God, rather than ſubmit to God, though he know that he ſhall be deſtroyed for it in the end: now there is this deviliſh diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in every one of our hearts; the pride of them lifts us up againſt God; we of our ſelves chuſe to be our own Lords, though we deſtroy our ſelves hereby, rather than <hi>Chriſt</hi> rule over us that we might be ſaved: <hi>Who is Lord over us</hi> is a queſtion ariſing from that proud diſpoſition of our Hearts; the proud Men in <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>as for the word thou haſt ſpoken in the Name of the Lord, we will not do it;</hi> this we all do, if God do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his word, and not work by his Spirit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe are to be reproved that <hi>receive it but as the word of Man:</hi> ſome do in a ſort receive the word, and think that they receive it aright; yet 'tis but as the word of Man, as</p>
            <p n="1">1. When they have nothing elſe to ground their Faith upon then humane Teſtimony; if the ſhould be asked, why they believe the word
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96826:98"/> to be God's? can give no other reaſon, then that their Fathers and Mothers ſaid ſo; and 'tis gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſo believed and embraced: now thoſe that believe it becauſe others believe it, receive it only as the word of Man; ſo the Papiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as the word of Men; and all that have no teſtimony from the Spirit, no true work on their hearts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe that perform Duties that are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the word to be ſeen of Men; as did the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> they Faſted, Prayed, and gave Almes; were zealous of the Law, all to be ſeen of Men; they ſought the praiſe of Men: now they that do any thing that the word requires, to be ſeen of Men, ſee not God in his word; they that love the praiſe of Men, and out of that ſeem to be Religious, receive the word only as the word of Men: then ſays our Saviour, how can ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve? 'tis impoſſible ye ſhould receive the word as God's, and believe it by a divine Faith, if ye ſeek Honour one of another. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.44. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you come to pray and hear, only to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy Man's expectations of you, you receive it but as Man's word.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe that take up Mens Ordinances as of equal authority with the word, are as zealous for a humane form of prayer as for the word, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they that make Man's words equal with God's, make God's word no better than Man's, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid our Saviour, <hi>Math.</hi> 15.3, 9. <hi>By your Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions you make void,</hi> &amp;c. you urge your Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as if they were ſo neceſſary as the word; and hereby you make void the word. That hath not any authority amongſt you as the word of God;
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96826:99"/> for Men to ſet their Threſholds by God's, their Poſts by his, is to defile his holy name, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.7, 8. that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, by making God no better than Man.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When Men look on the word as binding the outward Man, and not the heart: that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion conſiſts in a bodily exerciſe; that it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient if we come with our bodies before God, and honour him with our lips; as Men think it enough if you yield outward obedience to their commands, for they have no power over the Conſcience: Now if it be thus in matters of Religion, that our hearts are not brought into obedience to the word, that we think our thoughts and affections are free, and our hearts being looſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> gave this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Law: anger, hatred, ſpeculative uncleanneſs they thought were no breaches of the Law; when 'tis thus, the word is received but as the word of Man. Now how many are there that in theſe ways only receive the word of God?</p>
            <p n="5">5. When the word is received but in word only. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 15. <hi>The Goſpel came not to you in word only, but in Power.</hi> The word comes only in word, when 'tis not accompanied and ſet home on the heart, by power of the Holy Ghoſt; as on <hi>Lydia</hi> and the Jailor. <hi>Act.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Exhort. To ſtir you up to look on, and to receive the word as the word of God. <hi>Hear, and give ear, be not proud for the Lord hath ſpoken. Jer.</hi> 13.15. 'Tis God that ſpeaks in the word, God ſpeaks Promiſes, God ſpeaks Threatnings, and Commands; look on each of theſe as coming out of the mouth of God: the word is called <hi>the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96826:99"/> Spirit of</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s mouth.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.8. you muſt not only receive it in the Letter, ſo indeed only it comes from Man; but as the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s mouth, as breathed out of his mouth, and ſo as that it proves not a dead and an ineffectual Letter, but a quickning Spirit in you; that is, a new principle of Life, a new Soul in you; ſo as that you live by the word, act, and do all according to it.</p>
            <p>Now for direction, that the word may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by us as the word of God, know that ſomething is due to the whole word, and every part of it, as more general duties; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be done (that is ſome ſpecial Duties) with reſpect to the ſeveral parts of the word, as diſtinguiſhed one from another.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which is due to the whole word, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Faith: you muſt believe it to be the word of God, upon a clear apprehenſion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of it: your aſſent muſt be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the teſtimony of God: Conſider, there is a divine Faith, and a humane Faith; this is, when we believe a thing upon Man's teſtimony given of it, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> believed in <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the ſaying of the woman, this was but a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Faith: Divine Faith is when we believe a thing and give an aſſent to the truth of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a divine teſtimony that is given to it; as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> believed in <hi>Chriſt</hi> when they heard him, and ſaid, now we have heard him and know that this is the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> this was a divine Faith: now this is neceſſary to a right receiving of the word.</p>
            <pb n="180" facs="tcp:96826:100"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Where is this Divine Teſtimony that is given to the word?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'Tis contained in the word it ſelf; for as there is a light in the Sun ſufficient to diſcover it ſelf, ſo that when the Sun ſhines, its own light ſhews it to be the Sun; ſo there is a divine Light in the word, ſufficient to ſhew it to be the word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Why do not all then believe it to be ſo?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Becauſe Men are blind, and know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the things of God, neither are they able to judge of them: the light of the Sun diſcovers the Sun, but 'tis to thoſe that can ſee the light of it: ſo the word ſhews its divine Authority but to thoſe that are inlightned; ſo we muſt have the Spirit as eye-ſalve reſtoring our Spiritual Sight, and then we ſhall ſee clearly the word to be the word of God; and this is the firſt duty: we muſt receive the word as the <hi>Theſſ. Chap.</hi> 1.15. the Goſpel came not in word, but power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and much aſſurance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Fear. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. <hi>To him God looks that trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at his word.</hi> There is twofold trembling at God's word.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Slaviſh, only out of fear of Judgment, thus <hi>Ahab,</hi> and thus <hi>Felix</hi> trembled.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Filial; this is here meant, God looks to that heart that when it looks to God, and ſees any thing of him, trembles: now this is a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heart that's required to the right receiving the word; you muſt tremble at the word: that is, firſt, there muſt be in you an holy awfulneſs, humility and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>everence of Spirit, ſuitable to the Greatneſs and Majeſty, Goodneſs, Glory of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:96826:100"/> that God that gave his word: this is contrary to that pride of heart which is in every one of us by nature: when ever we have any manifeſtations or goings forth of the Glory of God, the out go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our hearts muſt be ſuited hereto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You muſt have an apprehenſion of your own vileneſs and nothingneſs. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.18. there was an appearance of the Glory of God, <hi>when I ſaw it I fell on my Face,</hi> as apprehending his own unworthyneſs to behold it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are ſpecial duties that reſpect ſeveral parts of the word.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hiſtories related;</hi> as of the Creation, of the fall of Man, drowning the world, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> here you muſt believe the report as made by God, and give not God occaſion to complain as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Lord, who hath believed our report?</hi> and look on all theſe as written for our Learning, on whom the ends of the World are come.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a Saviour deſcribed and ſet forth;</hi> which is the main ſcope of the Scripture: the eternally begotten word revealed in the written word, that came to deſtroy the works of the Devil, to ſave Sinners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> him you muſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace withal your hearts, entertain him as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> did: the whole word is a Goſpel bringing glad tydings of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> the old Teſtament is Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel throughout, in which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is (though more darkly) ſet forth; and in the New Teſtament more clearly: ſo that this is to embrace the word, to receive him whoſe name is <hi>the word of God. Rev.</hi> 19.13. to ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his fulneſs of Glory, Merit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to receive him as the word of the Father; this is to receive the word in power,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96826:101"/> to receive <hi>Chriſt</hi> into our hearts, and to have him revealed in us, and to have him formed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us; ſo as that <hi>Chriſt</hi> live, acts, and rules in us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>There are Promiſes:</hi> Now to receive theſe as the word of God, is to quiet our Souls in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on them, and aſſurance that they ſhall be fulfilled; that as his faithfulneſs hinds him, ſo his Power ſhall bring forth his Promiſes into Act. Say as <hi>Paul, I believe God that it ſhall be as he hath ſaid,</hi> that not one jot ſhall paſs unfulfilled: you muſt know <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the <hi>faithful witneſs. Rev.</hi> 1.5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>When Judgments are threatned;</hi> know that there is a Righteouſneſs, and Faithfulneſs in God that engages him to make them good; we are as averſe from believing Threatnings as Promiſes: therefore as God has confirmed his Promiſes by an Oath, ſo Threatnings likewiſe. <hi>Amos.</hi> 9.8.10. <hi>The Sinners among God's People ſaid, Evil ſhall not overtake nor prevent us. Deut.</hi> 32.40. If I lift up my hand to Heaven and ſay, <hi>I live for ever, I will make mine Arrows drunk with Blood:</hi> Now to receive this word, is to fear God and to prepare to meet him, as <hi>Jacob</hi> by wreſtling, <hi>&amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 26.8, 9. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12.2, 3, 4, 6.</p>
            <p n="5">5.

            <p>Now theſe qualifications make up that <hi>honeſt and good heart.</hi> Luk. 8.15. <hi>That having heard the

            <p>
               <hi>Sect.</hi> 1. Explaining the ſence of the Text.</p>
            <p>Take the meaning of the words thus, <hi>work;</hi> he means not, either that Sinners in their natural ſtate, can by working raiſe themſelves into a ſtate of ſpiritual Life; nor that Believers when they are ſpiritually quickned, can or ſhould ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Duties, as to think they ſhall merit Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereby; nor ſo work as the mercenary <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> did, truſting in their own works. <hi>Paul</hi> was no ſuch Legaliſt, but his meaning is, conſider the condition of your poor Souls, that they are wretched and miſerable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> look to the ſaving of them, ſtudy the way of Life; give not reſt to your eyes till you have found it out; ſearch the Goſpel, wherein Salvation is revealed, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be acquainted with the Myſteries of <hi>Chriſt: work out Salvation;</hi> this is meant two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Give Diligence to make Salvation ſure to your Souls, deſire that it may be made out to your Spirits in the evidence and demonſtration of the Spirit. Rejoyce in nothing but the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Salvation; that as it is wrought out in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo alſo in your Hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Work out,</hi> that is, Salvation being begun to be wrought, deſire the perfection and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it. <hi>Chriſt</hi> having begun to ſave you, look to be ſaved to the utmoſt by him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the firſt fruits of the Spirit, groan

               <hi>For it is God which worketh,</hi> this is a reaſon why we ſhould fear; take notice of the work of God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the work of God in the Heart,

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:96826:105"/>1. The Law, that's an Enemy to the Salvation of Sinners. Thoſe that are Enemies to it, it ſays Curſe; And it hath dominion over men that are under it. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was made under the Law who was above the Law, he obeyed the Law, being Lord of the Law. So hath fulfilled the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law, which it required of men, and undergone the Curſe due to Sinners as Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and conquered the dominion and killing power of the Law, ſo that the Law is not againſt the Promiſes, againſt the Salvation of ſuch for whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> is made a Curſe, ſo that there's no power in the Law to kill a Believer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sin. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was made Sin, it being imputed to him; he dyed under the Sin of the Elect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent puniſhment, and being an innocent and infinite and moſt Glorious Perſon, he ſuffered as much puniſhment as Sin deſerved, ſo Believers Sins ſhall never be puniſhed on them. And <hi>Christ</hi> dying under Sin, he now undertakes to be the deſtroyer of Sin; there may be motions of Sin, but motions of Sin in Believers are but Sin's death-pangs. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath given Sin a deadly wound: <hi>Our Old Man is Crucified with</hi> Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Chriſt</hi> dyed for the Sins of Believers. <hi>Chriſt</hi> will be the death of Sin in them: This is a ſure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ſo they ſhall not dye.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Satan. <hi>Chriſt</hi> aſcended and led captivity captive. He hath taken the Devil captive that had the Elect in captivity. <hi>Satan ſeeks to devour,</hi> but ſhall but ſeek to devour the Elect. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is conqueror of Satan, the Lord ſhall tread <hi>Satan under your feet, Rom.</hi> 16.20. and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall make them his foot-ſtool. Thus amidſt the many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96826:106"/> of Salvation, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall keep Believers to Salvation</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Christ</hi> is able to make meet for Salvation, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Know ye not, that no unrighteous Perſon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall enter,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. into the new <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> can Waſh, Sanctify, Juſtify: his obedience is more able to make Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, then <hi>Adam</hi>'s diſobedience to make Sinners; his Righteouſneſs is infinite, perfect, immutable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15, 17. The Juſtification of Believers depends on a ſure Foundation. <hi>Adam</hi>'s Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is a ſlippery Foundation, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s a ſure Foundation. <hi>No unclean thing ſhall enter;</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> of unclean can make clean.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is the ſame yeſterday, to day and for ever: ſo that ſtill Salvation depends on immutable Cauſes, and an immutable God, and an immutable <hi>Chriſt.</hi> His Righteouſneſs is the ſame, ſufficient to cover all Sin.

            <p n="3">3. On the Spirit's part ſure. The Spirit dwells in Believers, and whatſoever is required of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, the Spirit hath undertaken to do in them, <hi>I will put my Spirit in you, and cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, Ezek.</hi> 36.27. That Covenant which is confirmed unto you by immutable things, hath this Promiſe in it: He is a Spirit of Faith, Love,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:96826:106"/> Meekneſs, and of Light to lead into all Truth, to make the heart willing to follow <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>King,</hi> to deny ſelf. This Spirit is the earneſt of Heaven and perfect Glory. The Father hath made a bargain, confirmed by his Word and Oath, and by giving earneſt: This bargain he Seals, and the Seal is the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. This is a Seal that is ſufficient to confirm Believers, that Glory ſhall be perfected, becauſe they have the Spirit of Grace. That Spirit that dwells in them ſhall quicken their mortal bodies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Salvation of Believers is in it ſelf moſt ſure, <hi>ſo it may be made ſure to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Some have attained it, <hi>Job</hi> 19. <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth</hi> &amp;c. <hi>David, Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.38. <hi>I am perſwaded,</hi> &amp;c. He includes himſelf; and this was not a ſingular p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iviledge given to ſome Saints more eminent then others, or an extraordinary gift. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which ordinarily God was pleaſed to beſtow on the Saints, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Ye have received the Spirit of Adoption whereby ye cry Abba Father.</hi> This is true of all Believers, and the <hi>Spirit beareth witneſs.</hi> The Spirit where he is a Spirit of Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is uſually a witneſſing Spirit, ſealing up their hearts, ſealing up and treaſuring Salvation in the heart. The aſſurance of Salvation is a precious Jewel, which ordinarily the Spirit doth treaſure and ſeal up in the hearts of Believers: giving the firſt Fruits of Heaven to their hearts. And as <hi>Moſes</hi> on <hi>Nebo</hi> had a view of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo 'tis not unuſual for the Spirit to carry up the hearts of Believers above the World into the third Heavens, and give a ſight and taſte of that moſt Excellent Glory.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:96826:107"/>3. A way is ſhewn in the Goſpel in which it may be attained, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9. <hi>Say not who ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. Do you doubt of Salvation? Are you in fears about it? Conſider, <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath been in the deep, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in Heaven; <hi>Confeſs with thy mouth the Lord</hi> Jeſus, <hi>and believe with thine heart, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> As <hi>Christ</hi> coming into the Ship when toſſed and almoſt full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there was a great calm, an end put to the Diſciples fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. So <hi>Chriſt</hi> coming into the heart, rebuking fears, revealing himſelf as dying, riſing and ſitting at the Right hand of God, there ſhall then be a great calm in the heart, <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Peace, Joy, hope of Glory in the heart.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Salvation ought to be made ſure,</hi> it is the Duty of all that look towards Heaven, to make their Salvation ſure, this is that which ſhould be in your aims and deſires, <hi>Rejoyce that your names are written in Heaven,</hi> ſaith <hi>Christ, Luke</hi> 10.20. This ſhould be the matter of the Saints Joy; this implies that we ought to ſeek after the aſſurance of this, that our names are written in Heaven: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart,</hi> that is, ye that look on God as the Life of your heart, God in <hi>Christ</hi> reconciled, loving, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing us, the Peace, Joy, Delight, Contentment, and Reſt of the Heart. <hi>A true heart,</hi> is a heart that ſays concerning God, as the Rich Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Riches, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe in God,</hi> and with full aſſurance of favour and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God. And then ſhews how it may be attained, for the Goſpel as it requires things to be done, ſo it ſhews us the way how: The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel requires not impoſſibilities, but makes all its
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96826:107"/> Precepts poſſible; The Law did not thus, it did not make its Precepts poſſible, but the Goſpel doth, it leads to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by whom whatever is required, is or ſhall be accompliſhed as to Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: Now look to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo your hearts ſhall be ſprinkled, fear and guilt ſhall be purged out of the Conſcience, and Peace, Joy and full Aſſurance brought in, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Give all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make your Calling and Election ſure.</hi> And if Election, then Salvation; there is a Golden Chain mention'd, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30. if you get hold of one link of it then you have hold of all; this reaches from Eternity to Eternity; from Eternity of Election, to Eternity of Glorification; Now our care ſhould be to faſten on this Golden Chain, this Golden Chain is fixed in Heaven, let it alſo be fixed in your hearts, ſo ſhall you have hope as an Anchor fixed in Heaven, and ſo Heaven ſhall have faſt hold in you, and you ſhall have faſt hold in Heaven; Heaven ſhall not looſe you, nor you ſhall not looſe Heaven.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Nothing beſides Salvation can be made ſure.</hi> The Life of your Bodies cannot be made ſure, the Life of your Souls may, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>For we know that if our earthly Houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved we have a Building of God, an Houſe n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The favour of Man cannot be made ſure, the favour of God may. Riches on Earth cannot be made ſure, they will fly from you, or you ſhall fly from them. Riches of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may be made ſure, worldly proſperity and
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:96826:108"/> happineſs cannot be made ſure. Earthly Men in their beſt eſtate of proſperity ſtand but in ſlippery places. But everlaſting happineſs in Heaven may be made ſure. Honour amongſt Men can't be made ſure, Honour with God may. Creatures can't he made ſure, <hi>Chriſt</hi> may: Comforts flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Creatures cannot be made ſure: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations abounding by <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be made ſure.

So then take heed of ſpending your ſelves for them. Salvation alone, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Heaven, the favour of God alone can be made ſure; ſo labour to make that ſure and nothing elſe. Judge the making Salvation ſure the one thing that's neceſſary, becauſe that alone can be made ſure.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Salvation and nothing beſides Salvation is worth the making ſure.</hi> If you have Riches, worldly proſperity and abundance, if you have health, and Houſes to dwell in, Children, Men Servants, Women Servants, Sheep, Oxen, Shops full of Wares, <hi>&amp;c</hi> Hearts full of contentment in enjoying of theſe things, what ſhall all this avail you?

Salvation perfected is the bringing of a Creature into the preſence of God, making it partaker of the Glory of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> God ſhining to the Soul in all his Glory, <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his infinite Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency: God ſhining on the Soul in perfect likeneſs and ſuitableneſs to him, <hi>We ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3.

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96826:109"/> Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs hath ſhined in our hearts, giving the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, unto the Soul, then the Soul is at reſt. God appearing in the Glory of his Love, reconciled in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> in the Glory of his All-ſufficiency, Power and Wiſdom; God appearing as your God to your Souls; the ſeeing of your ſelves to be partakers of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with <hi>Chriſt;</hi> that as <hi>Christ</hi> hath the Divine Nature, ſo you partake with him in it; this is aſſurance of Salvation. Now is not this a Pearl worth the ſelling all to purchaſe it?</p>

               <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Fxhort. To perſwade you that amidſt the multitude of your Affairs and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments in the World, this may not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, but with the greateſt diligence proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the making your Salvation ſure to your ſelves: As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>above all keeping keep the Heart;</hi> ſo above all working work out your own Salvation, make ſure that which may be made ſure, and is indeed worth the making ſure: You are made for ever, if once your Salvation be made ſure; and whatever you are, you are moſt miſerable, if the Salvation of your Souls be not made ſure. Be not like <hi>Martha</hi> troubled about many things, cumbred with much ſerving, with ſerving your Luſts, ſerving of Men, ſerving of the Body: Take heed of looſing your Lives, in ſeeking to ſave your Lives. Take heed of looſing your Souls in ſeeking the things appertaining to the Body, of coming ſhort of Heaven. in your toiling in Earth: but chuſe with <hi>Mary that better part:</hi> She ſate at <hi>Jeſus</hi> his Feet and heard his word, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.39. Look on this as <hi>the one thing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96826:109"/> needful,</hi> as the beſt part that you can chooſe; to hear the word of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to ſearch the Goſpel of <hi>Christ,</hi> to ſtudy that Salvation that is in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And wrought out in their hearts that come to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> behold that life and immortality that is brought to light in him.</p>
            <p>To provoke hereto, conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Father makes it his great work to ſave Souls: a greater work than the Creation of the World, wherein more of his Glory is manifeſted, the greateſt of God's works next to the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Son of God. Now as God makes it his great work; ſo next to the glorifying of that God in <hi>Christ,</hi> this ſhould be your greateſt work, to get an aſſurance of your Salvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> died to make Salvation ſure to the Elect, to the Children of Promiſe; 'tis ſo glorious a work that <hi>Chriſt</hi> valued it above his own Life; he delighted not ſo much in his own Life as in the Salvation of Sinners. The Son of God pleaſed not himſelf, that he might do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever pleaſed him: He denied himſelf, that might do what he pleaſed: He humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that was Lord of Glory, that he might ſave poor loſt Souls: He put himſelf into the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition of Sinners, that they might be tranſlated into his eſtate of Happineſs and Glory; ſo this is a moſt glorious work; for to take Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or make <hi>Christ</hi> ſure; or the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, Eternal Life in him, ſhould be your great work; and ſuch a work as you ſhould not leave, though you may be reproached and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in it: we ſhould be contented to looſe Temporals to make ſure of Eternals; to looſe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:96826:110"/> Life to ſave Life. If you were in a Ship at Sea that was full of Gold, and in danger of drowning, you would caſt out all to ſave your Life; ſo let all things ſtoop to this work of ſaving of your Souls: yet it is not always ſo, you may make Salvation ſure, and keep your Riches, haply enjoy Peace, and not endanger your temporal lives.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Salvation aſſured ſhall be an Anchor ſure and ſtedfaſt to your Souls, you ſhall ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> holding you faſt, and hereby you ſhall hold faſt <hi>Christ.</hi> And hereby you ſhall have Hope, and Joy in the greateſt troubles, there's no Tempeſt of afflictions ſhall carry away your hearts from Peace. Your Joy is ſure Joy, your Comforts ſure Comforts, if you have this ſure and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt Anchor; nay there's no ſin ſhall trip up your heels of Joy and Peace in <hi>Chriſt</hi> with the Father, in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Righteouſneſs to cover your Sin, in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſatisfaction for Sin; it ſhould work in you Godly ſorrow for doing any thing repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to his Glory; but it ſhould not diſturb a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers Joy in God.

Now, <hi>have your Feet ſhod,</hi> that is, walk in Goſpel-ways, have the Goſpel of Peace in your hearts, believe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Promiſes, Goſpel Grace, Goſpel Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: have a Goſpel Spirit. So you are well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and walk through troubles, dangers and oppoſitions, in the midſt of Satan's fiery darts, and the World's reproaches, and ſtill the life of your Peace and Joy in the Love of God in <hi>Christ</hi> be preſerved, <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>Take the Helmet of Salvation; Salvation</hi> being made ſure ſhall be an Helmet on your Heads, whereby you ſhall receive the blows of Tongues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not be hurt; this ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend you againſt all the Curſes of the Law, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.17. <hi>Herein is our Love, or Love with us made perfect, that we may have boldneſs in the day of Judgment.</hi> When others ſhall fear the Wrath of the Lamb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you ſhall have boldneſs and not be aſhamed in this World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſure, the Soul dwells in God, in the Love of God, All-ſufficiency, Power, Wiſdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The more aſſurance you have of your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the leſs earthly will your thoughts and hearts be; this will raiſe your Spirits and carry them up to God in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> So that,</p>

            <p n="1">1. The Salvation of a Perſon may be ſure, and yet he want the aſſurance of it. Salvation may be made ſure in Heaven, yet not in the Heart;

And that he may look on God's Favour and Loving-kindneſs, as that which is better than Life; and that he may ſay as the Spouſe, <hi>thy Love is better than Wine.</hi> Spiritual Joy is ſometimes in danger to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in worldly Joys. The Souls of Believers are ſometimes oppreſſed with carnal ſecurity, as the Spouſe when <hi>Chriſt</hi> came. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>I have put off my Coat,</hi> &amp;c. Then <hi>Chriſt</hi> withdrew himſelf; worldly things withdraw the Heart too much from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and that may cauſe a withdrawing of God from the Soul.</p>
            <p>Now the Directions to Saints. 1. How to get aſſurance are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Take heed of ſurfeiting with worldly Joys and Contentments. If with <hi>Solomon,</hi> you will not withold your Hearts from any Joy, God may withold Joy from your Hearts; the Earth being betwixt us and the Sun, this makes it night with us; if the Earth get betwixt our Hearts and God at any time, they being overtaken with worldly Contentmentt, this may intercept divine light, and keep it from you; ſo let your Souls dwell in God, and not like <hi>Satan,</hi> walk to and fro in the Earth and wander up and down in it. The Apoſtle's Rule is an excellent one: <hi>Let them that have Wives be as if they had none, and thoſe that be
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:96826:117"/> Rich, as though they had no Riches,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29.30. and thoſe that buy as if they poſſeſſed not; that is, let not your Hearts find reſt in theſe things; but let the love of God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> be your reſt; live above, let your Souls dwell in God, and God will dwell in your Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Give not way to Sin, eſpecially take heed of doing any thing againſt the light of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. There is nothing more likely to cauſe a withdrawing of light, than a walking contrary to light: hereby light is rejected and ſtifled: and when Believers will have Fellowſhip with Sin, God may teach them to take heed of Sin by hiding himſelf, and ſuffering of their Souls to be filled with terrors. By Sin Believers may fall, though not from the love of God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet from the light of his Countenance; That is the Apoſtles triumph, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Nothing ſhall be able to ſeparate me from the love of God in</hi> Chriſt: yet there may be a falling from the love of God in the Heart, by Sin; ſo then take heed of being over taken with it; have no fellowſhip with unfruitful works of darkneſs, but reprove them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Walk not in the light of your own fire, and ſparks of your own kindling, the Children of Promiſe that are free are yet too much in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to the Covenant of Works, looking to a Righteouſneſs of their own, to Duties. Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hopes of favour and acceptation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon: God may ſuffer thoſe to lye down in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that look not higher for ground of Joy: When the Wiſe men left following the guidance of the Star, it left them, they walked in their own light, and they go to the High-Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:96826:117"/> and enquire of them, but when they returned then they ſaw the Star.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Be well Principled in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and labour to underſtand it aright. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That though the Sins of Believers have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded, yet Grace abounds much more: that is, there is Grace enough in God and to ſpare, for the pardon of all Sins. God hath an infinite and inexhauſtible treaſure of Grace, What God's anſwer was to <hi>Paul</hi> may be applied to all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9: <hi>Paul</hi> was the chief of Sinners, and God had Grace ſufficient for him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. <hi>He obtained Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>might ſhew forth all long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a pattern to them that ſhould believe on him to everlasting life.</hi> Believe the abundance of Mercy in God through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and you ſhall taſte the fulneſs of it: look on Sin, and from Sin to Grace, and there is Grace ſufficient for you, ſo you may have Peace in your heart.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As their diſobedience bath abounded, ſo hath <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s obedience much more. <hi>As by one man's diſobedience many were made Sinners, Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>So by the obedience of one many ſhall be made Righteous.</hi> There is more Power in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Righteouſneſs to Juſtify a Sinner, than there is in Sin to Condemn him. God is more honoured by <hi>Chriſt</hi> than diſhonoured by Sin: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is an infinite Perſon equal to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he fulfilled the Law that was Lord of it. It appears, becauſe ſufficient to make a Sinner as Righteous as if he had never ſinned, ſufficient to blot out all Sin that there's no more remembrance of it. Sufficient to recompence God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:96826:118"/> beſides there is merit in it. It's a price ſufficient to purchaſe Glory, Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here will be frequent acts of diſobedience, againſt theſe ſet the infinite obedience of the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding beyond them all, as a Sacrifice ſufficient to take away the evil of all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God had never ſuffered the Elect, ſuch as are ordain'd to life, to have been in a ſtate of Sin before Converſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or to do any act of Sin after Converſation, but that he intended to glorify his Grace and Mercy in pardoning their Sin, and ſaving them notwithſtanding their Sin: this was his deſign from all Eternity, to magnify his Grace and Mercy towards the Veſſels of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. That he might <hi>make known the Riches of his Glory, Rom.</hi> 9.23. So he ſuffered them to Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.24. <hi>The Law entred that the offence might abound:</hi> that is, that it might be known how far, and how exceedingly it abounded. Alſo by the entring of the Law Sin was irritated, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this that Grace might be magnified towards the Elect in pardoning them, and giving <hi>Chriſt</hi> to dye, and ſaving them notwithſtanding their Sin. Now this may uphold the Soul in the apprehenſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n of Sin, God never intended that Sin ſhould hinder the Salvation of the Elect, but to work good even out of ſin, and to take occaſion from thence to magnify his Grace more abundantly; ſo let us have recourſe to Grace manifeſted in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But though God by his abſolute power might ſuffer ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet ſin is never theleſs ſinful, and ſo we ought to withſtand ſin to the utmoſt; and we muſt not do Evil that Good may come of it: that is the note of Reprobates whoſe damnation is juſt. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:96826:118"/>4. The ſin of Believers may cauſe the hiding of love, but no hatred; they have not Indignation and Wrath, but Compaſſion: God looking on the reliques of ſin as their infirmities, that he will heal. Now as Believers out of infirmity do ſometimes ſin, ſo it is an infirmity to infer hatred in God towa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſin is contrary to the mind of the Spirit. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.27. We grieve at any thing that happens againſt our minds.</p>

            <p n="5">5. The ſins of Perſons ſealed by the Spirit are ſaid but to grieve the Spirit, not to ſtir up Wrath and Indignation, and a readineſs to revenge.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Conſider that ſins ſhould grieve, and but grieve the Godly; they ſhould not doubt of Love, and fear Wrath, if once the Soul truſts in the Name of the Lord, and ſtay upon God: If

Secondly, His Glorious State of Exaltation. This is a ſtate of fulneſs. <hi>Christ</hi> being advanced to fulneſs of Glory. In his firſt eſtate he had the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily. In this latter the fulneſs of the Godhead clearly manifeſted forth in him. And he had as much Glory in his humane Nature as the fulneſs of the Godhead in him can bring into him: this is <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s meaſure

               <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s fulneſs, that is, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath as Man, be like to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in ſtate of Knowledge and of Glory; as in his growing eſtate, ſo in his perfect eſtate. <hi>Chriſt</hi> had as much Glory as he is capable of from the fulneſs of the Godhead in him; So they ſhall have as much Glory as they are capable of from <hi>Chriſt</hi> dwelling in them, as the <hi>Father</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as 'tis <hi>John</hi> 17.23. <hi>I in them, thou in me, that they might be made perfect in one.</hi> This is the Saints meaſure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There are ſeveral degrees by which the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Believers is carried on to perfection.</hi> 'Tis much diſputed amongſt ſome whether there are degrees of Glory in Heaven: whether one Saint differ from another in Glory, but this is beſides the buſineſs I have in hand, nor need it to be ſpoken unto.

All ſhall have ſuch a meaſure as they are capable of from <hi>Christ.</hi> But this is evident, that it is by ſeveral ſteps and degrees that Saints attain to that meaſure of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. As 'tis ſaid of thoſe that did come from the remote parts of <hi>Judea</hi> to worſhip at <hi>Jeruſalem, Pſ.</hi> 84.7. <hi>They go from strength to ſtrength to appear in Sion.</hi> They encreaſe in ſtrength and courage till they they come to Sion. So Believers encreaſe in ſtrength in Faith, Love, Knowledge, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs till they come to Heaven. Believers go from ſtrength to ſtrength. <hi>The Righteouſneſs of God is revealed from Faith to Faith, Rom.</hi> 1.17. that is,

Saints at their firſt converſion are further off from Salvation; then they come nearer and nearer to it daily. <hi>Christ</hi> reveals himſelf gradually, as <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Chriſt</hi> coming towards the Spouſe did reveal himſelf gradually; She firſt hears his Voice, <hi>The Voice of my Beloved,</hi> and then hath ſome ſight of him: <hi>Behold he co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, leaping on the Mountains, and skipping upon the Hills;</hi> overcoming difficulties, leaping over all, ſo as that nothing hinders acceſs. And he cometh ſwiftly, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>Behold he ſtandeth behind our Wall, and looketh forth, or in at the Window,</hi> yet without doors, not ſo near as he will be, yet nearer now then he was before The Spouſe firſt hears his Voice, and then ſees him coming, and then at laſt enjoys his preſence. <hi>I have many things to ſay, but ye cannot bear them now, John</hi> 16.12.

               </hi> and ſo ſhall they ſee and enjoy <hi>Chriſt</hi> perfectly. And as <hi>Chriſt</hi> reveals himſelf ſo the Spirit is poured out gradually, perfecting knowledge, perfecting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs by degrees. As the ways of God manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to the World, have been by degrees, proceeding from leſs perfect to a more perfect
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96826:122"/> way of manifeſting himſelf, as firſt in Creatures made, then in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and in <hi>Chriſt</hi> firſt, ſet forth by carnal things, Types, and Shadows repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him; then through <hi>Christ</hi> coming in the Fleſh, raiſed up to Glory, and ruling the World by him, till all his Enemies are ſubdued, and the Elect perfected, <hi>then the Son ſhall be ſubject that God may be All in All;</hi> Then the Godhead ſhall moſt gloriouſly appear: So it is by degrees that God manifeſts himſelf in the hearts of the Elect; and by degrees that they are brought nearer and nearer to him. Here they enjoy him by Faith, in Heaven by Viſion: here by Fellowſhip with the Spirit, having the Spirit bringing in Light, Grace and Comforts into the Soul; in Heaven they ſhall ſee God to be <hi>All in All,</hi> and be in his preſence.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The great Deſire of Believers, and Endeavour ought to be that their Salvation may be perfected.</hi> When God hath begun to ſave them, they ſhould deſire to be ſaved to the utmoſt. As God did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the <hi>Jews</hi> three times a year every Male to appear at the place, which God did ſet apart for worſhip; and leave their Wives and Eſtates to the Protection of God, who promiſed that the Enemy ſhould not ſo much as <hi>deſire their Land</hi> at that time: This is to ſhew that Believers ought above all to deſire to appear before God, and to be in his preſence; and ſhould be content to leave all worldly enjoyments. There's nothing to be ſo much deſir'd, ſo much priz'd as to be with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This you may ſee both in Precepts and Examples, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Let us run with patience the Race that is ſet before us.</hi> The buſineſs of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:96826:123"/> ſhould be to run towards Heaven: As the <hi>Jews</hi> going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> their buſineſs was to go to <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo the great buſineſs of a Chriſtian is to travel towards Heaven, and this ſhould be their great deſire. As thoſe that run in a Race ſtrive to be at the Mark; they put forward with all their might: ſo do Chriſtians with all their Souls and ſtrength. Heaven, and nothing but Heaven ſhould be lookt on as the place of reſt, <hi>looking unto Jeſus.</hi> Make <hi>Chriſt</hi> your pattern. What was his great deſire? <hi>Father glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee. Glorify me with the Glory I had with thee before the World was.</hi> There was Joy ſet before him: ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſet before the Saints, revealed to their Faith; they ſhould long to ſee him as he is, Glory is ſet before them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the World is Vanity, in themſelves Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Croſſes on all hands, Shame, Reproach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Before and above all, in Heaven is ſet everlaſting Joy, <hi>Pleaſures for evermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where this Joy is there Believers hearts ſhould be; the mind, the will, and affections of a Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhould ſtill be travelling towards this Joy, running a Race towards Heaven: as 'tis ſaid of the Creature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21. <hi>The earneſt expectation of the Creature waiteth,</hi> &amp;c. The Creature is in Bondage to Corruption, Slaves to Luſts; this is contrary to the end for which the Creature was made; they naturally make towards that end, to be Servants to the Saints, and to be inſtrumental towards the manifeſting the Glory of the Creator, and to be free of Bondage: So ſhould Saints deſire perfect freedom from Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, to enjoy the Liberty, the Inheritance, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:96826:123"/> and perfection of the Sons of God, in the preſence of God.</p>
            <p>This hath been the great deſire of Believers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. <hi>We which have received the firſt Fruit of the Spirit;</hi> What is meant by theſe? The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of Grace, Knowledge of <hi>Christ,</hi> Faith, Love, Humility, Heavenly Mindedneſs, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Conſolations of the Spirit; we that have received theſe, <hi>groan within our ſelves.</hi> We would receive the whole lump of the Spirit, there are burdens we groan under. Sin is a burden, when the Spirit hath wrought Holineſs, earthly things are a burden; they cannot be gotten but by the ſweat of our brows; when Salvation that is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is believed, then mortal eſtates are a burden: when immortality is brought to Light, then to be out of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s preſence is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; where Glory and the fulneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is revealed, <hi>we groan waiting for Adoption,</hi> &amp;c. There's Adoption in making you Sons, and there's Adoption in beſtowing the Inheritance, Glory, and Liberty which belongs to them, as they are the Sons of God.</p>
            <p>They that are Sons, and have the Spirit of Sons crying to God <hi>Abba,</hi> would fully enjoy all the Priviledges, all the Glory, and all the love which belongs to them, as the Sons of God in <hi>Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>To depart, and to be with</hi> Chriſt <hi>is far better,</hi> beyond all compariſon better: there's Joy without Sorrow, Holineſs without Sin, Knowledge without Ignorance, Eternity of all. So to be in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the World is infinitely better, then to be in the World enjoying the contentment of it, without <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And to be in Heaven with

            <p n="1">1. Such as have nothing before them, but worldly things, worldly profits and pleaſures, that have their hope only in this Life, and not Hope as an Anchor fixed in Heaven, but the love of the World fixed as an Anchor in the Earth,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:96826:124"/> whereby their Hearts and Souls are faſtened to the World; that (with the two Tribes) could be content to have their Portion on this ſide <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan;</hi> that their Houſes, Lands, and Temporal Lives might continue for ever; would deſire no better Portion, that ſee more gain in Life than in Death: this is an evidence that they have not drunk of the Water that <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives; their Souls have not been filled with the Glory of the World to come; they are not acquainted with the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> they know not <hi>the price of the High Calling of God in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus. This is an inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable property of a true Believer, a deſire to have his Salvation wrought out, and finiſhed; where ever this work is begun, the Heart would have it finiſhed; where Holineſs is begun, the deſire of the Soul is to have it perfected. There's no greater burden than Sin to a Gracious Heart; all the Contentments of the World cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent a believing Soul; nothing beneath Heaven, nothing without the Preſence of God, nothing beſides the Glory of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> can make it perfectly Happy: to be where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, that is beſt of all.</p>
            <p>Faith will make us ſojourn in the World; when you are in the way of Salvation, perfect Salvation is the mark which the Soul preſſes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Now lay your Hearts to the bond of this undoubted Truth, and do not conclude your ſelves to be in the way of Life, if perfect Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not the mark you preſs towards; if it be not the preſence of the Lord, that you account the perfection of Happineſs: if you could be contented with worldly Felicity, and your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:96826:125"/> are only towards the things of this Life; then the root of all Evil is yet alive, and growing in you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such as dream of a preſent perfection;</hi> that think they know as much as they need to know, and do as much as is needful to be done. He that thinks he knows enough knows nothing as he ought, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. He that thinks he hath enough of <hi>Christ,</hi> hath nothing of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Where there is true Knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> begun, the Soul is carried out with ſuch earneſt deſires to know more, that it accounts it ſelf to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>I forget that which is behind.</hi> Gal. 4.9. <hi>Now we know God, or rather are known of God;</hi> we are known perfectly, but we do not know perfectly. <hi>Brethren, I count not my ſelf to have apprehended:</hi> I follow after, I do not ſit down ſatisfied with that I have, but I follow after that which I have not, that I may apprehend that, for which I am apprehended of God. God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the Elect in Love; he apprehends by his Spirit, to bring nigh to himſelf, to make Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Mercy and Glory: and they deſire to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend God, and to be nigh him, and to be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led brim full with Mercy and Glory; they that are full already, are moſt empty. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.53.</p>

To ſee him in whom all fulneſs dwels, and to be like him, that is the brightneſs of the Fathers Glory, is Glory enough. So theſe are two great things that ought to be your mark.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Grow in the <hi>Knowledge of</hi> Chriſt. <hi>Math.</hi> 13.11. <hi>To you it is given to know the Myſtery of</hi> Chriſt. To know the great Myſtery of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; to you a Spirit is given to lead you into all Truth; to you the Promiſes are made of being taught of God: Deſire Knowledge, and believe this Promiſe, ſo more and more ſtill of the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Excellency, and Glory of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Grow in <hi>a conformity to</hi> Chriſt. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is perfectly Holy, labour to be more like him in Holineſs; let the ſame mind be in you as in

            <p>
               <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. <hi>Direction</hi> about this great work, of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out our Salvation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Propoſe right ends to your ſelves.</hi> Intermediate, and Mediate.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Intermediate ends,</hi> that you may have <hi>perfect Happineſs, perfect Redemption from all Evils, and that an end may be put to Sin and Sorrow,</hi> that there may be no more ſinning, nor no more ſorrowing. The deſire of your own good is not unlawful, if you deſire Heaven as your Happineſs, <hi>Christ</hi> as your Life, the preſence of God as your beſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this you ought to deſire as your happineſs, the enjoyment of God as your chief good, and perfect likeneſs to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the moſt perfection, that you can be made partakers of. Thus did <hi>Paul</hi> deſire his own happineſs, and good, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. <hi>We which are in this Tabernacle do groan,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>To be cloathed upon, that immortality may be ſwallowed up of life,</hi> that Vanitv may be ſwallowed up of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Earthly things of Heavenly, Temporal of Eternal; that is, you muſt not make it your Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be Rich, Great, Renowned, and Happy in the World; but to be Rich, Glorious and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in Heaven. Lay not up for your ſelves Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on Earth, but in Heaven; ſay not to your Souls, there are Goods laid up on Earth, but
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96826:126"/> much Glory in Heaven, Treaſures which Moth and Ruſt cannot corrupt, nor Thief break through and ſteal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Your own Happineſs muſt not be your <hi>chief and ultimate end,</hi> but <hi>the Glory of God.</hi> Deſire that perfection of Glory may be given you, that God may have all that Glory which he expects from you. Mark that Petition. <hi>Father glorify thy Son, that thy Son alſo may glorify thee. Joh.</hi> 17.1. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your own Glory for the Glory of God: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire perfect Knowledge, and perfect Holineſs, that you may do nothing beſides Glorifying God, that you may not come ſhort of any degree of Glory that he expects from you. It is the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Exerciſe of the Saints in Heaven, to ſing Hallelujahs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Lay aſide every Weight:</hi> As thoſe that run in a Race will not load themſelves with unneceſſary weights, and <hi>he that ſtrives for Maſteries is tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in all things.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.15. He will take heed of Surfeiting and Drunkeneſs; ſo in running this Spiritual Race towards Heaven, lay aſide every weight, whatever may be a clog to your hearts, to ſlacken your diligence from endeavouring after the encreaſe of Heavenly perfections, whatever may draw down your hearts from Heaven, what may remit your deſire of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s appearing, and of being in his preſence. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Love of the World:</hi> This will be a heavy weight on hearts to hinder their aſcending to Heaven. If the Mountains ſhould fall upon your Bodies, theſe would be ſuch a weight, that you would not be able to ſtir in the leaſt motion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them: the love of the World in the heart,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96826:127"/> is as great weight upon the Spirit, it ſuppreſſes breathings of Spirit after Heaven, it quenches thirſtings after Heavenly Glory: Take heed of loading your hearts with this weight, do not load your ſelves with thick clay. So much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate love as there is to the World, ſo much weight is in your Spirits, preſſing them down from Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The cares of the World:</hi> Theſe are a weight, they beget Heavineſs in your Spirits, and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto Spiritual things, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.34. <hi>Take heed of ſurfeiting, and drunkeneſs, and the cares of the World.</hi> Provident cave is not forbidden, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By this is meant ſuch hearers as hear the word, and go forth and are choaked, with the cares, riches, and pleaſures of the World, and bring no fruit to perfection, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. If you give up your ſelves to theſe, this will hinder the bringing Fruit to perfection. Worldly Men bar Fruit but not <hi>Fruits to perfection,</hi> no Faith, no Love, Repentance Reformation; ſo if Saints be overtaken with theſe, this will hinder much their growing onwards to perfection, in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in Grace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Worldly Sorrow. The Sorrow of the World worketh Death.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10. The ſorrow of the World, that is, grieving more for Suffering than
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:96826:127"/> for Sin, growing under the want of Temporals, more than of Spirituals: this is a weight, it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders deſire after a Heavenly Life, preſſing on to Salvation; this depreſſes the Spirit. Godly Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, what carefulneſs it wrought? what zeal? what vehement deſires, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> Lay aſide the weight of worldly ſorrow.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Sin. Eſpecially the <hi>eaſily beſetting Sin. Heb.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from the body of Death?</hi> This is a weight in <hi>Paul</hi>'s Spirit, <hi>when I would do good, evil is preſent; there's a Law in my Members,</hi> &amp;c. Deſire that Sin may be ſubdued, look to the Law of the Spirit of Life in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to free you from the Law of Sin and Death; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Luſts that are moſt prevalent, that do moſt eaſily prevail, that the Soul is uſually over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with; your <hi>Dalilah, Herodias,</hi> your Right Hand, your Right Eye. The following a Luſt, takes off the Heart from following after Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Run your Race with Patience;</hi> that is, firſt, be not angry if the Bleſſing longed for be not preſently beſtowed: be not like thoſe that ask, <hi>where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi> Hope and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wait for the Salvation of God. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.26. <hi>All my appointed time will I wait till my change come.</hi> Secondly, Be not angry at the Croſſes you meet with in the way of Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s prevailing Sin, whereby they vext the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They could not with patience bear any Croſs, in the way to the Land flowing with Milk and Honey. <hi>Satan</hi> and the World ſet themſelves againſt the Heirs of Salvation, that labour to work it out, and with patience endure their buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetting:
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96826:128"/> There's great reaſon for it; for <hi>our light Afflictions, which are but for a moment, work for us a far more Exceeding, and an Eternal weight of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Afflistion is not worthy to be compared with the Glory that is to be revealed. Rom.</hi> 8.18. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. Skin for Skin, all that a Man hath, will he give for his Life; endures any thing, parts with any thing, rather than part with his Life.</p>
            <p>He that will looſe his Life, ſhall find it; looſe Earth to find Heaven, <hi>&amp;c. Pſa.</hi> 84. Going through the Vally of <hi>Baca,</hi> a dry place, make a Well: this is a Well; they going to God can ſatisfy themſelves with his Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. <hi>Look to Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of Faith and Love,</hi> &amp;c. The Author and Finiſher of Grace and Glory: Believe that he (who is mighty to ſave) will carry on the work to perfection. The <hi>Jews</hi> had the Angel of God's preſence with them to keep them, and to drive out the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites,</hi> &amp;c.

He will bear in his Love and Pity, as by his power, as the tender hearted Mother bears her Child in her Arms: Believers they have <hi>Chriſt</hi> to overcome their Spiritual Enemies, <hi>Chriſt</hi> to feed them, and ſupply them with Spiritual Nouriſhment, Bread
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96826:128"/> from Heaven, and with water of Life, giving by his Spirit; ſo look to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the Author and Finiſher of Salvation. As the Cloud and Smoak by day, and the flaming fire by night, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was a ſign of God's preſence, ſo God promiſes. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 4.5. <hi>I will create on Mount Sion and her Aſſemblies a Cloud,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the ſhining of a flaming Fire; Shining,</hi> for Light to the Saints; <hi>Flaming,</hi> for Terror to the Enemies. <hi>Chriſt</hi> will be as careful of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers now, as of the <hi>Jews</hi> of old; believe that you have the Angel of his preſence, to conduct you to his preſence: and ſo hold faſt your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence firm unto the end, and you ſhall receive the end of your Faith, the Salvation of your Souls. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is paſſed into Heaven as Prieſt, he bare Sin on Earth, but now he is entred without Sin; Jeſus the Son of God. So hold faſt your Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Here's an encouragement, there's no infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath felt the like. So then come boldly to the Throne of Grace, by Faith go to the Throne of Grace in Heaven, for Grace to help you to Heaven; have Hope as an Anchor fixed in Heaven on a Throne of Grace, fixed in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo ſhall you be drawn nearer and nearer to Heaven.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>With fear and trembling.</hi> As the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Men to ſet about a work of following <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of ſaving their Souls; ſo it gives di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for the way, and ſhews where ſtrength is to be had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here you have a manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the way and manner, in which Salvation is to be wrought out.</p>
            <pb n="238" facs="tcp:96826:129"/>
            <p>Whence the Doctrine is.</p>
            <p>Doct. 3. <hi>Salvation is to be wrought out with fear and trembling.</hi> Whereas in the former Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſomewhat ſeemed to be aſcribed to the Will and Power of Man, as if he could do ſomewhat towards the perfecting of his Salvation: This that the Apoſtle adds in theſe, and the following words, takes away all colour and ground of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing any thing to Nature in this great work. But ſhews it to be the ſole work of God's Grace and Power in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And there being a glorious manifeſtation of God in this work, revealed in the Hearts of Believers, that's a ground of fear and trembling.</p>
            <p>Now for the opening of this point, I ſhall ſhew, what is not meant by Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not <hi>a ſlaviſh fear of Judgment.</hi> The fear of Chriſtians ſhould be filial, <hi>i. e.</hi> fear of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring God ſhould reſtrain from Sin, not fear of being deſtroyed, but an earneſt deſire of being accepted; Not a dread of Vengeance ſhould move you to walk in Holy and Goſpel ways. Chriſtians ſhould not be driven to ſeek Heaven meerly out of fear of Hell; but drawn by the Glory of Heaven, and Pleaſures for evermore in the preſence of God. Not driven by fear of the wrath of the Lamb, but drawn by the Cords of the Love of the Lamb. The fear of Chriſtians ſhould not be the fear of Slaves, but the fear of Sons: Not the fear of <hi>Cain. Every one that findeth me ſhall ſlay me,</hi> but the fear of <hi>Joſeph. Gen.</hi> 42.18. <hi>I fear God. Exod.</hi> 20.20. When <hi>Iſrael</hi> feared becauſe of the thunderings, <hi>&amp;c. Moſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>Fear
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96826:129"/> not, for God is come to prove you, that his fear may be before your faces that you ſin not.</hi> Fear of Evils God doth not account <hi>his Fear,</hi> his fear is not Sin. Believers are ſet beyond the fears of Evil; they have no ground to fear wrath and vengeance: 'Tis an Infirmity to do it, and proceeds from weakneſs of Faith. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 23, 24. 4. E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ery Believer ought to ſay as <hi>David: I will fear no Evil.</hi> But they may rejoyce in Love, and expect good, and count that all things ſhall work for good to them. In <hi>Christ</hi> they are carried above all fears of Evil, for their Hearts ſhould not fall down in them, ſo that fear of Evil is not the thing here required; this is forbidden elſewhere, as by <hi>Moſes, fear not:</hi> ſo not enjoined here.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Fear of <hi>Doubting and Diſtrust.</hi> Trembling oppoſed to Confidence and full Aſſurance is not here meant. Men in a natural condition out of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> may well be under the tortures and rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this fear, they may be in bondage through fear of Death. They may be toſſed with fear and doubting, and ſay, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven? Who ſhall deſcend into the Deep?</hi> Or, who can tell whether we ſhall go to Heaven or Hell? But for Believers that are in the way of Salvation, they ought not thus to fear; 'tis for ſuch that have no other Spirit, but the Spirit of Bondage; which Believers do not receive: If they are in bondage, 'tis not the Spirit of God, but the unbelief of their own Spirit is the cauſe of it. <hi>We have received the Spirit of Adoption, whereby we may cry Abba Father.</hi> They are Sons, having the Spirit of Sons. Now as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſays, <hi>the Servant abideth not in the Houſe for ever, Joh.</hi> 8.35.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:96826:130"/> He may be caſt forth; and ſo is ſubject to fears: So Men in a natural eſtate, are in danger to be caſt forth into outer darkneſs. But the Son abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ever, he is beyond fear: ſo Believers are Sons, they are always in L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Apoſtle Exhorts. <hi>Let us draw near with a true Heart in full aſſurance of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. Let us come boldly to the Throne of Grace. Now if he ſhould exhort to fear and trembling, becauſe of doubtings of Salvation; he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it to himſelf, and make void his other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations.

Work out your Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</hi> Believers ſhould have full aſſurance of their Salvation, and great confidence that God will carry it on, and yet fear and tremble. This fear is not contrary to, but the Fruit of Faith and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:96826:136"/> Confidence: The more is known of Divine Love and Grace, the more we ſhould fear. This fear and trembling ſhall continue, even when the Saints are made perfect, and their Salvation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd. The Seraphims fear and tremble in the beholding of Infinite Glory; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> as Man fears and trembles at the Glory of the Godhead dwelling in him. This is the beſt frame of Heart, a fearing and trembling frame, Reverencing, Admiring, and Adoring the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Greatneſs and Goodneſs of God to poor Sinners. Hereby God is acknowledged in his greatneſs, and advanced; and the Creature brought low, and its nothingneſs is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, amidſt the boldneſs of acceſs we have. Fear and Trembling is planted in the hearts of Believers, that the infinite diſtance, and diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betwixt God and the Creatures might be acknowledged. So endeavour to abound in this excellent grace of fear. God is called the Fear of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he was the God of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> So ſaid God, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and Jacob, and the fear of Iſaac.</hi> So God your God in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> God appointing you to Salvation in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhould be your fear. <hi>Fear,</hi> ſo as to adore his Glory, admire his Grace, and fear to do any thing contrary to his Glory. Take heed of a ſenceleſs benummed Spirit, unaffected with the glorious diſcoveries of the Divine goodneſs; take heed of high-mindedneſs, and of carnal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: be like the Church that walked in the <hi>Fear of the Lord.</hi> So walk towards Heaven in fear; run your Race in fear and trembling: you are running towards God, the preſence of God;

Now this upright Will, this Conſent of heart, is wrought in all that are in the way of Life. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſteps by which Salvation is wrought.

            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> works two ways, for ſaving the Elect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God was in</hi> Chriſt <hi>reconciling the World unto himſelf.</hi> That is, <hi>God</hi> gave <hi>Chriſt. Chriſt</hi> Satisfied his Juſtice: he puniſhed ſin on <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> did accept of what <hi>Chriſt</hi> did as perfect ſatisfaction. <hi>And God was in Chriſt.</hi> That is, while <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diating, Redeeming, Dying, and Riſing, <hi>God</hi> was in him. Hereby he was ſtrengthened for the work, and ſupported in it; hereby the price of his blood is of infinite Value: his Obedience of infinite Merit, ſufficient to Redeem out of
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:96826:139"/> Miſery, and to purchaſe an Inheritance of Glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God in the heart perſwading to live to God in Chriſt,</hi> and to accept of Life that is offered. Thus drawing in their hearts to <hi>God</hi> as the Life of the Souls. <hi>God</hi> in the heart reconciling it to himſelf, making it willing to have <hi>Chriſt</hi> rather than the World: and <hi>God</hi> rather than the Creature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>In reſpect of Conſent of heart to ſerve God, in Chriſt.</hi> The heart of a Chriſtian is thus made willing, that <hi>God</hi>'s will ſhould be its | Rule above its own, it is made Subordinate unto it, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaid when the Law was given. <hi>All that the Lord hath ſpoken we will do.</hi> There was their conſent that the Lord ſhould Rule them, and they would fear him. So this is the will of a Chriſtian under the Covenant of Grace, and in the way of Life. <hi>All that the Lord ſpeaks I will do.</hi> Lord (ſays <hi>Paul) What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> The Angels and Saints cryed with a loud Voice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Expreſſing their willingneſs that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be honoured as King, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.11, 12.</p>
            <p>There are two things to be obſerved, about the tenders of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Goſpel unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The fulneſs of <hi>God</hi> that's held forth in him, even his Blood, the <hi>Way</hi> to it: that is, Faith in his Blood, Mediation, and Interceſſion: hereby is acceſs to <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Terms</hi> on which Sinners muſt take him. For that, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſays, <hi>If any Man will follow me, let him deny himſelf,</hi> Self-righteouſneſs, Pleaſure, Profit, and any thing that ſtands in oppoſition to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Let him take up his Croſs, and chuſe to
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:96826:140"/> ſuffer rather than ſin: and loſe any thing rather then me, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.24. He muſt love <hi>Chriſt</hi> more than all things; then he will conſent to leave all things for <hi>Chriſt:</hi> So let him follow me, and go whither I lead him, walking in ſuch ways as I command him. Then the Man doth will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, when he conſents to take <hi>Chriſt</hi> in both theſe reſpects. There is fulneſs of good in him, and I will take him, and depend on him for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good thing. This ſhall be my Hope, Joy, Reſt, and Life for ever. All good is treaſured up in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the fulneſs of the Godhead is in him. He ſeeks no further, I have found him whom my Soul loveth, and am abundantly ſatisfied with him. I am Empty, Poor, Blind, and Naked: I will buy of him Gold, White Rayment, Eye-Salve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he hath bought my Life, bought my Service, and he is worthy of it. And I am not my own, I will glorify him. This is the will of a ſound Chriſtian that is in the way of Life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are <hi>doing Christians, Math.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> He that is travelling in the way towards, Heaven, is careful to do the will of the Father in Heaven. Doing his will is not the way, ſo as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the way; but ſuch as are in the way are <hi>doing Chriſtians.</hi> He that looks on <hi>God</hi> as the <hi>Supreme Good,</hi> can't but look on the will of <hi>God</hi> as the <hi>Supreme Rule;</hi> and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>God</hi> as the <hi>Supreme End:</hi> and if <hi>God</hi> be in the heart, he will be in the Life. <hi>God</hi> is ſeen in his doings, he that dwells in <hi>God</hi> will work in

               </gap> labour ſhall not be in vain. Altho' your work deſerve not a Reward, yet God will not forget your work of Faith, and labour of Love. So Chriſtians that are in the way of Life, muſt be doing in the Lord; ſuch as are travelling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven muſt have their converſation in Heaven: they that walk towards God, muſt walk with God.</p>

            <p n="2">2. I ſhall diſtinguiſh of <hi>God's working,</hi> which is two fold.</p>
            <p n="1">.I In the old Creation. So 1.

            </p>
            <p>For the proof of this <hi>Three</hi> things are to be clear'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſider. <hi>In the Natural man there's no free will to Spiritual good,</hi> no embracing or doing of it. There is free will to Sin in the Men of the Old Creation: Free will to natural actions, in as much as herein they act by Knowledge and Election, chuſing to do this, and not that. There's no free will to Spiritual good.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe they are under ſuch darkneſs that covers it,</hi> that they can't know, and apprehend Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual objects: Spiritual things can't be apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but by a Spiritual Eye. Now the Soul of every Man is Carnal, 'tis impriſon'd in Fleſh, it dwels in thick darkneſs. As God is ſaid <hi>to dwell in thick darkneſs,</hi> becauſe his glory is vailed and hid, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.12. He is hid by the thick covering of Carnal things, that he doth not ſhine forth in Spiritual glory in the World: ſo the Soul of man dwells in thick darkneſs. God is above it, and full of Glory, Splendor, and Majeſty in himſelf; Men are under it, they are darkneſs, ſo that they cannot look beyond things Carnal: they ſee no good but in things Carnal. The Carnal Man perceives not the things of the Spirit of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he know, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. So can't chuſe and embrace them. What the mind can't know as good, the will can't embrace as good. Now
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:96826:146"/> this mind cannot judge and apprehend God in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the chief good. When <hi>Peter</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who he was, he replies: <hi>Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed this to thee, but my Father which is Heaven, Math.</hi> 16.17. There's no more of ſaving Spiritual Light in the Carnal Man before the New Creation then there was of Natural Light before the Old Creation. The Men of the Old Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have Light whereby they know the Creatures, and have Souls terminated in them: but not Light whereby they know God. Whence the Apoſtle ſais, <hi>Ye were darkneſs, Eph.</hi> 5.8. Men naturally dwell in the darkneſs, and not in the Light of the Lord. They walk in the darkneſs of Creature-comforts, and not in the Light of Divine glory. And that which ſtrenghtens this argument is, that Men love darkneſs that covers them. They had rather dwell in darkneſs than in the Knowledge of the glory of God. Men do turn from Light, and would turn the Light from them. A Man hath free will towards darkneſs that he chuſes: but not free will towards Light, that he refuſes. <hi>Light is come into the World,</hi> into the Old Creation, but Men as Men in a nat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

God hath ſhined in the Heart, and in the Face of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and hath appeared in his Glory, ſhed abroad his Love, and hath taken away the Heart of Stone, in which there is no free will to God, and given a Heart of Fleſh in which there is a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ee will to God, a conſent to be ſaved by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The Spirit acting by Light and Love, convincing the Soul of the worth of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and ſtirring up to a following of the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that heart can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon out ſervice. <hi>Chriſt is worthy becauſe a Lamb ſlain,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. And the heart chuſes to ſerve <hi>Chriſt:</hi> here's free will to the doing of good. When <hi>Chriſt</hi> is revealed in his Glory as moſt lovely, and the Soul is brought into the treaſures of good that are in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and ſees a fulneſs in him, and
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:96826:147"/> then embraces him: here's a free will in embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of good; a chuſing of <hi>Chriſt</hi> above the World. You are not ſound Chriſtians unleſs you have ſuch a free will as this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That free will to Spiritual good which is in the renewed man, is of God's working.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſais, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt in me, Gal.</hi> 2.20. So that a Believer hath free will, and he acts free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the ways of God, he embraces what God ſhews to be good, he ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſes the things that pleaſe God; yet not he but <hi>Christ</hi> in him. <hi>Chriſt</hi> lives, <hi>Christ</hi> wills, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> works that which is good in him. <hi>Without me ye can do nothing, John</hi> 15.5. There's no free will nor power to do good, till <hi>Chriſt</hi> be in the heart. <hi>I can do all things through</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſtrenghtening me.</hi> I can will as I ought, and do as I ought through <hi>Chriſt. Chriſt</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines to good actions, <hi>Christ</hi> ſtirs up to good actions.</p>
            <p>Now this will further appear by conſidering the great deſign of God in ſaving Sinners. As all God's works are God's manifeſtations, ſo God intends in this work a glorious manifeſtation of himſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In his <hi>Power,</hi> as in the firſt Creation, his Eternal Power and Godhead is to be ſeen, ſo in the ſecond Creation, <hi>Eph</hi> 1.19. The Apoſtle prays that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> might have the Spirit of Wiſdom, and Revelation, <hi>to know the exceeding greatneſs of his Power to them that believe.</hi> God's deſign is not to make known the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Free will: but his own power in the exceeding greatneſs of it. If the Converſion of a Sinner be but by Moral perſwaſion, by holding
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:96826:147"/> forth of Spiritual objects to be embraced; then how is it that the exceeding greatneſs of power is manifeſted to them that believe, if Faith come forth from free will, and power of Nature, only excited and ſtirred up by Divine Grace? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So certain it is that Faith is made out of nothing: there's no diſpoſition in us towards believing, but 'tis a work of Divine Power creating it in a Soul moſt empty of Spiritual good.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In his <hi>Grace,</hi> which he declares, firſt in the <hi>freeneſs</hi> of it. For it is by meer Grace that any are called and juſtified. There's nothing that that puts a difference betwixt one and another, nor why one embraces the Goſpel and another does not, but meer Grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4:7. <hi>Theſe things I write that no one be puffed up againſt another, for who maketh thee to differ?</hi> If Men have free will to good, if that <hi>Will</hi> be not meerly of God's working, whereby one Man doth embrace <hi>Chriſt</hi> and lay hold on the Promiſe of Life, God doth not make him to differ, but his own free will doth ſo: and ſo this opinion directly oppoſes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Goſpel to commend Grace in its free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Free will eſtabliſhed in natural men makes void free Grace. As the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>If of works then not of grace, elſe grace is no more grace, Rom.</hi> 6.11. So likewiſe if of free will, grace is no mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e grace, and if of grace then nor of free will. So when the Goſpel is Preached to all and ſome lay hold on it, and embrace <hi>Christ</hi> in their hearts, and follow him, and others refuſe, and go on in evil ways leading to deſtruction: What makes the difference? Divine Grace God works a will in one and not in another; the one he brings

               </gap>l to good is nor in nature, but where 'tis it is a fruit of free Grace. God works to will.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in the <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of it, when the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is inſufficient and can do nothing to procure pardon, and to make his Peace, <hi>Grace</hi> gave <hi>Christ.</hi> And when <hi>Christ</hi> is offered, and there's no power to embrace <hi>Christ,</hi> then Grace gives to believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and works a conſent in the will to take <hi>Christ.</hi> When there's no power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Corruption, and to do good, Grace gives the Spirit to be a living, conquering Law cauſing Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection.</hi> Some may object againſt this truth, for eſtabliſhing of free will in the Natural Man, from the general and Univerſal render of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every Creature. God gave his Son that all that believe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.17. <hi>Whoſoever will, let him take of the Water of Life freely.</hi> To what purpoſe are theſe tenders, if there be not free will and power in Man to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Theſe general tenders of Grace do not argue in Men a freedom of will to receive Grace, or a power to believe, but only a duty to Believe: Men ought to believe, ſo all are called on; and unbelief is Men's ſin and greateſt ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Election only ſhall lay hold on the Grace of the Goſpel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. <hi>Iſrael hath not obtained, but the Election,</hi> that is, ſuch perſons as were Elected, hath obtain'd it; and the reſt were

            <p n="3">3. The Preaching of the Goſpel, the holding forth of the Promiſes of Life in <hi>Chriſt</hi> to Sinners, is the miniſtration of the Spirit to thoſe that are ordain'd to Life: that's the way in which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit comes down into their Souls, and is a Spirit of Faith and Love in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>The will of God is not determined by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> God works in a Creature a will and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be ſaved by <hi>Chriſt:</hi> ſo the Creatures wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and embracing Salvation, doth not work a will in God to ſave him: as the Apoſtle ſays. <hi>We love God, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. The love of the Creature is not the cauſe of the love in God; but the love of God is the cauſe of love in the Creature: ſo Man wills becauſe God wills, and works to will: God doth not ſo will the Salvation of Man, becauſe Man wills it. There's an Opinion abroad that advances the Creature, and the power of Nature to embrace good offer'd, and that makes the will of God in relation to Salvation, wholy dependent on the will of Man, and determin'd by it. They ſay, God wills Salvation to all alike, and is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to this or that Man but by the right uſe of free will. This day if Man's will conſents to take <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. then God wills his Salvation. To morrow if he be off from willing what he did before, then God is off from willing his Salvation. And thus God's will is not the firſt mover and cauſe of things but Man's will. This is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by this Text, God determines the will of Man.

               <hi>Conſid.</hi> 1. God wills the Salvation of ſome, but not of all; the Goſpel ſays, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>God will have all to be ſaved.</hi> But this is meant of ſome of all ſorts; not of all, of all ſorts, and God wills it; that is, calls on all Men to receive the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, invites all to come to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo he wills it with his offering will, but not with his ordaining will. That thus appears. <hi>Eſau</hi> was a Perſon God never did will to ſave: <hi>For before they had done either good or evil, that the purpoſe of God might stand; God ſaid, the Elder ſhall ſerve the Younger, Jacob</hi> have I choſen, <hi>Eſau</hi> have I hated. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. <hi>There is Election of God.</hi> What is that? <hi>A chuſing of one;</hi> that implies a paſſing by of another. If there be any ſuch thing as Election from Eternity, which the Scripture ſo often ſpeaks off, then God doth not will the Salvation of all.</p>

And as there was before, ſo there was when the Law was given on <hi>Sinai,</hi> a <hi>Sabbath</hi> given. <hi>There remains a</hi> Sabbath, <hi>a day of holy reſt for the People of God.</hi> Let us ſearch this Scripture then, and ſee whether there will not c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me forth of it a <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> for a <hi>Sabbath</hi> now under the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The Prophet was ſent <hi>to ſhew the Houſe of</hi> Jacob <hi>their Tranſgreſſions,</hi> and in particular to reprove them of their <hi>Hypocriſy in the Duties they perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and eſpecially in their faſting, which was a counterfeit Faſt, and then ſhews them what is the <hi>true Faſt,</hi> and then makes many gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; which is his uſual method after reproving preſent Evils: he makes Promiſes, which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had reſpect to preſent times, but chiefly to the times of the Goſpel, as we ſee plainly in the next Chapter. He mentions preſent Sins and preſent Judgments. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. He complains that no Man did endeavour to ſet things right, and ſo declares the <hi>Lord putting on Righteouſneſs, and an Helmet of Salvation, to execute Vengeance on his Enemies:</hi> and then the Effect of this, <hi>They ſhall fear the Lord from the Weſt. And then the Redeemer</hi> ſhall come to <hi>Zion.</hi> And in this obſerve how ſuddenly he falls into Prophecying of Goſpel times, and the laſt of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:96826:153"/> them. For ſo he doth, as appears, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. <hi>There ſhall come out of Sion the Redeemer, and ſhall turn ungodlineſs from</hi> Jacob. Thoſe words are brought in as a Proof for calling the <hi>Jews,</hi> and bringing in the fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In like manner he doth here; which will the better appear if we conſider the particulars of this Prophecy in this Chapter, which will manifeſt that theſe chiefly reſpect the laſt Goſpel times.</p>
            <p n="1">1. See <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Thy Righteouſneſs ſhall go before Thee,</hi> &amp;c. that is, <hi>The Lord thy Righteouſneſs,</hi> as he is call'd in <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. When we conſider that their Righteouſneſs ſhall go before, that's ſome evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this ſenſe as beſt.</p>
            <p>Beſides, in what time is it that <hi>Christ</hi> and the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be called by this Name? and why? In the place before mentioned it is ſaid: <hi>Behold the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe unto</hi> David <hi>a Righteous Branch, and a King ſhall Reign, and proſper, and ſhall Execute Judgment and Juſtice in the Earth. In his days</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſhall dwell ſafely.</hi> So 'tis to be fulfilled when <hi>Iſrael</hi> as well as <hi>Judah</hi> are brought out of bondage: then he ſhall be <hi>The Lord our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Jer.</hi> 33.14. At the ſame time the Church of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be call'd, <hi>the Lord our Righteouſn ſs.</hi> So here, <hi>Thy Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, <hi>the Lord thy Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. So this Prophecy reaches to that time of the Goſpel, when the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be called; eſpecially conſidering what follows, <hi>The Glory of the Lord, ſhall be thy Rereward;</hi> that is, there ſhall be a time, when the Lord's preſence with, and providence towards his Church, ſhall be as eminently (haply more eminently) on, with,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:96826:153"/> and towards the <hi>Jews,</hi> than when they came out of <hi>Egypt. Then the Lord their Ruler, went before them in a Cloud and Pillar of Fire;</hi> and when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> purſued them, the Cloud and Pillar went behind them; ſo then the Glory of the Lord was their Rereward. And now in this time, not only the Lord as Ruler, not only <hi>David</hi> their King, but the Lord their Righteouſneſs ſhall go before them, and the Glory of Power and Grace, ſhall be their Rereward.</p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>Now obſerve, as it appears that theſe Promiſes have reſpect to the Goſpel times, ſo the condition of them is a ſtrict <hi>obſervation of the</hi> Sabbath-day <hi>under the Goſpel.</hi> And ſo in this Prophecy of the Old Teſtament, we find a <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> for the Chriſtian <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which may well go under its old and firſt Name, though another alſo be given it under the New Teſtament; <hi>The Lord's day,</hi> which now we are to obſerve by vertue of the Fourth Commandment, tho' the day be changed, and the Fourth Commandment does require us now to obſerve the firſt day of the week, that being made a <hi>Chriſtian-Sabbath</hi> by divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as much as it did the <hi>Jews</hi> to obſerve the ſeventh day, which may be cleared by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Second Commandment, which hath a negative part, <hi>not to make any graven Image,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding Men to inſtitute, and appoint ways of Divine Worſhip; and an affirmative part, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring us to worſhip God in theſe ways, and in
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:96826:157"/> the uſe of theſe Ordinances which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. So under the Law the Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand did bind Men, to obſerve the Ordinances of Circumciſion, the Paſſover<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and offering Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. And now under the Goſpel, it bind us to obſerve Goſpel Ordinances, as Baptiſm, the Lord's Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remains the ſame, only hath different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: ſo the Fourth from the beginning, and under the Law did oblige to the obſerving of the ſeventh day, and now the firſt day; yet the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is in matter the ſame; there's no change in the Command, only it hath different reſpects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> How doth this change appear? and how will it be made out, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> commanded the obſervation of the firſt day?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's evident there was Apoſtolical and Chriſtian practice of it in the Primitive times, and ſo ever ſince; then were the ſolemn meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings for Worſhip. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Upon the firſt day of the week, when the Diſciples came together to break Bread,</hi> Paul <hi>Preached unto them till midnight.</hi> And then Collections were made for the Poor. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2.

               </gap> by Divine Inſtitution, may be gathered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From <hi>Mark.</hi> 2.27. <hi>The</hi> Sabbath <hi>was made for Man, and not Man for the</hi> Sabbath. <hi>ver.</hi> 28 <hi>For the Son of Man alſo is Lord of the</hi> Sabbath-day. I gather this hence, Man did need a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and it was given to Man becauſe he doth ſtand in need of it; Men do need and cannot be without it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore the Son of Man who is Lord of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> muſt give him a <hi>Sabbath, God ſhall ſupply all your need, Phil.</hi> 4.19. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not, then he was not ſo faithful as <hi>Moſes;</hi> he gave a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> did want it: therefore it is not to be queſtioned, but that <hi>Chriſt</hi> gave a Command for the <hi>Chriſtian-Sabbath.</hi> Let this then be well conſidered, the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was made for Man's benefit, for his good; and he ſo needed it, that he can't well be without it: and <hi>Chriſt</hi> being Head, will give what the Members do need; the Lord will give what the Servants do need; the Husband will give what the Spouſe ſhall need.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When it was given <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, 'twas made for <hi>Adam</hi>'s good, and becauſe he ſtood in need of it; and if <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency did need a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> do not we much more now? that we may the better recover what was loſt by the fall.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was made for the <hi>Jews,</hi> this was one of their advantages. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.1, 2. <hi>What advantage had the</hi> Jews? <hi>Much every way, they had Oracles, and the word of God,</hi> they had his Laws. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 147. <hi>He dealt not ſo with other Nations;</hi> and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular the Law of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:96826:158"/> and as much profit in it. Now if Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans under the Goſpel ſhould not have a <hi>Sabbath</hi> given them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than the advantages of the Law were above the advantages of the Goſpel; and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which the <hi>Jews</hi> had, beyond the profit of Chriſtians; whereas the advantages of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, are beyond the advantages of the Law; the miniſtration whereof exceeds in Glory, in Profit, and Advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> How was the <hi>Sabbath</hi> made for Man?</p>
            <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>For man to reſt in,</hi> for the reſt of his Body from labour; and of his mind from thoughts, care and ſtudy about his worldly Affairs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis for Man that he may ſet himſelf in a more ſolemn, and ſerious manner to praiſe the Lord for the great work of Redemption by</hi> Chriſt. <hi>i. e.</hi> the work of the new Creation begun, and for the works of Providence. <hi>Sabbath</hi> work is the work of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, begun on Earth. It was made for <hi>Adam,</hi> that on the ſeventh day he might contemplate and praiſe God for the work of the ſix days; and he was to think on God manifeſt in the Creatures, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to ſee the inviſible things of God, his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power and Godhead in the things that were made. The <hi>Chriſtian-Sabbath</hi> is made for the Saints to contemplate <hi>the great Myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. As Man was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, Quickened, Called, Sanctified, <hi>that he might be to the Praiſe of the Glory of his Grace, and</hi> to ſhew forth the Vertues of him that died and roſe again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So this is the day <hi>the Lord hath made</hi> for the ſolemn Performance of this work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis for a Man <hi>to gather Manna for the ſix Days.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> were to gather Manna for the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:96826:158"/> body on the ſixth day for the ſeventh, we on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> for the ſix days; this is a day to trade for the Soul, <hi>to buy of</hi> Chriſt <hi>Gold, white Raiment and Eye-ſalve,</hi> and to be digging for Wiſdom, and to ſearch out for hid Treaſures. <hi>As God hath given A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and Prophets for the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thus you ſee the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is made for Man, for his uſe, good, and benefit, and he can't be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: his Body and Soul need it, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is Lord of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> and it being ſo neceſſary for them, he would make a <hi>Sabbath</hi> for them, and not make it void. <hi>He came not to deſtroy, but to eſtabliſh the Law.</hi> Math. 5.17.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be handled is, <hi>that there ought to be</hi> (and when the Church ſhall be Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the World, there will be) <hi>a ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the</hi> Sabbath. As appears in this place.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If thou turn away thy Foot from the Sabbath-day,</hi> to unlawful Works, to ſinful Company, not go any unneceſſary Journeys, or to Sports, and Recreations; you muſt not walk your own Steps, as well as not ſpeak your own Words.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Turn from doing thy Pleaſure,</hi> ſelf-pleaſing works, are <hi>Sabbath</hi> prophaning works. God's pleaſure is to be fulfilled then altogether, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our own pleaſure is to be done in that time; all bodily Recreations are forbidden, all works tending to our worldly profit are unlawful, for we muſt deny our ſelves in point of Pleaſure, and ſo alſo in point of Profit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Not finding thy own ways.</hi> Moſt properly the works of Men's Callings are their <hi>own ways: Let every Man abide in his Calling;</hi> the works of our Calling are our own works, theſe muſt not be done on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> they are the works of the ſix days.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Not finding thine own Pleaſure.</hi> As we muſt not ſet our ſelves to ſelf-pleaſing works, ſo if any pleaſurable Objects are preſented and come in your way, you muſt not <hi>find them,</hi> that is, you ſhould not take notice of them, nor regard them: If they find you and tempt you, do not you find them. <hi>Satan</hi> lays matter of Pleaſures in your way, but do not find and take it up.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Nor ſpeaking your own words.</hi> Such words as you may ſpeak at other times: we ought not
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:96826:159"/> to be ſpeaking of worldly Matters: what we muſt not do, what we muſt not find pleaſure in, that we muſt not talk of: as we muſt not work, ſo we muſt not talk of work, we muſt not Buy, Sell, Plow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo we muſt not talk of theſe things on the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> 'tis prophane and prophan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing talk.</p>
            <p>This is the negative part, ſhewing what is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. Next is the affirmative part,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Call the Sabbath a delight.</hi> The <hi>Jews</hi> did bear burdens on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned it; many there are, who if they bear no burden on their backs, yet when they are engag'd in <hi>Sabbath</hi>-work bear burdens on their Hearts.

Now in the beloved City Ordinances ceaſe, and the keeping of one day in ſeven ceaſes: but in the Camp of the Saints, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> amongſt the Nations ſaved and walking in the light of the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> there will be Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and the keeping of the <hi>Sabbath</hi> in manner as is here preſcribed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſes.</hi> If there ought to be ſo ſtrict an obſervation of the <hi>Sabbath day:</hi> then, how ſhort do men come of the keeping of it! Where are the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be found that walk on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Rule?</p>
            <p n="1">1. How looſe are ſome in their Principles, in writing and ſpeaking againſt a Divine Inſtitution
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:96826:162"/> of it, as if there were not ground for the keeping of it, but from Cuſtom and the Commands of Men; and ſo it ſhall be but the Holy of Men, and not the Holy of the Lord: whereas this is that which makes it <hi>H nourable,</hi> and is the ground why we ſhould call it Honourable, becauſe it hath the ſtamp of <hi>Divine Authority upon it.</hi> And it's <hi>Chriſt</hi> that is the Lord of it, and not Man.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And what looſneſs is in the practice of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all? Who be they that turn their Feet, the Feet of the Body and Soul from it? Where are any to be found that do not find their pleaſure, and ſpeak their own words? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Learn what reaſon there is to long for that glorious Reformation which ſhall be in the World. As the <hi>Creatures groan to be delivered for the bondage of Corruption,</hi> and from being in ſuch bondage to Men's luſts, who do abuſe them ſo much to the diſhonour of God, and make them the matter of Sin: So thoſe that have the firſt fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſhould groan within themſelves, waiting for the Adoption. That is, as they that believe have the power of Sons, ſo they ſhould wait for the Inheritance of Sons, and long to have more of the Spirit of Sons, that thereby they may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled as in their whole courſe to carry themſelves as Sons towards their Heavenly Father: So on the <hi>Lord's day</hi> they may come before the Lord in that Holy, Spiritual, and Heavenly frame which is here required. What a bleſſed time will that be, when <hi>he that is feeble</hi> and fails ſo much in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>ſhall be as David,</hi> the Man after God's own heart, doing all his will? <hi>Chriſt</hi> adviſed the <hi>Jews</hi> to pray that <hi>their flight might not he on the</hi> Sabbath-day.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:96826:163"/> Many times there is flying on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> and this is ſad times: Sometimes there is fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Meetings, flying from Duties for fear of Enemies; and too often our Hearts on that day are flying away from God, and the duties of his worſhip; upon the wings of worldly thoughts and affections. A happy time will it be with the Saints, when there ſhall be no flying on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> no flying upon the wings of fear, nor no flying upon the wings of worldly love: but then <hi>David</hi>'s wiſh ſhall be fulfilled to thoſe that ſhall ſerve the Lord, and <hi>David</hi> their King, and fear the Lord and his goodneſs. <hi>They ſhall have the wings of the Dove,</hi> wherewith they ſhall fly to the Holy, Spiritual, Soul-refreſhing reſt of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> and fly to Heaven to the Throne of God and the Lamb, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Uſe.</hi> 2. <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Let that Holy, Spiritual Strict Obſervation of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> which ſhall be hereafter, be your pattern now.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It will be a good evidence of your being in Covenant, and of the truth and reality of Grace, when you can thus holily and ſpiritually keep a <hi>Sabbath</hi> to the Lord. This is the Man that is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to perform the duties of his Calling on other days, to the honour of the Lord: he will work, he will Buy and Sell, he will Plow and Sow, he will Eat and drink to the honour of God; and he will be careful that his buſineſs in the World be acted in Religion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.1, 2. <hi>Keep Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, do Juſtice. Keep the</hi> Sabbath <hi>from polluting it.</hi> The former comprehends the duties of the Second Table, the latter the duties of the Firſt. So neceſſary is it to the right worſhipping of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:96826:163"/> God, to keep a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> that this is put for, and made comprehenſive of all the duties of God's worſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thus ſhall you be the better prepared for a Storm. For as here are Promiſes of being above troubles, of riding on the High places of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So hence you may conclude you ſhall have protection under trouble. The true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers who worſhip God in Spirit, and rejoyce in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> may have great confidence, and peace in their hearts in ſuch a day, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 27.4, 5. <hi>One thing have I deſired of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In the time of trouble he ſhall hide me in his Pavillion, in the ſecret of his Tabernacle,</hi> &amp;c. Thoſe that come to his pavillion-love, to be where God is, and to be near him, and to have communion with him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the Woman is in the Wilderneſs, ſhe is <hi>nouriſhed there,</hi> and when a ſtream comes and the <hi>Dragon</hi> caſts out a flood out of his Mouth to ſwallow her up, the Earth ſhall help her: this is the Storm falling on the Remnant of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's ſeed, during the time of the witneſſes ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. and 12. being compared 'twill appear that, <hi>thoſe keeping the Commandments of God and teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> are Heirs of thoſe Promiſes that are made <hi>of the Spirit of Life to enter into the witneſſes,</hi> which ſhall make them ſtand upon their Feet. Theſe ſhall <hi>aſcend in a Cloud,</hi> and be above the Earth-quake, and ſo in this great Storm be preſerved as ſeed of that Glory which ſhall follow to the Church.</p>

            <p n="2">2. They ſhall delight themſelves in the works and ways of God towards them. The Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God ſhall be all delightſome Providences.

Then God's works ſhall be like his thoughts, <hi>of good and not of evil, to grant an expected end</hi> So his works are good and there's no afflicting evil in them, and God will give the Saints their expected end, that is, what from his word they did expect to be accompliſh'd here in the World, not the laſt and utmoſt end, that is, fulneſs of Joy in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The groaning Creature ſhall have its expected end, the liberty of the Sons of God,</hi> in which its Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is wrapt up. <hi>Then upon all ſhall be written, Holineſ to the Lord;</hi> and not be then the Luſts of

The Covetous Man makes his Riches the Luſts of his Eye; <hi>and the Pride of Life,</hi> Men that have much are uſually proud of it. This is the Creature's bondage and burden to be ſo, but then the Sons of God that poſſeſs and uſe them well, will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God with their Subſtance, their Fields are like thoſe of <hi>Canaan, Fields of Offerings; they ſhall Conſecrate</hi> their gain to the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when thus the Creature ſhall have its expected end.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The groaning Saint and Servant of God ſhall have his expected end, the Adoption, the Redemption of his Body.</hi> They ſhall ſit under their Vines and none make them afraid, and ſtand before the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſhall have Peace flowing in like a River; and Grace flowing in abundantly. <hi>I wil pour out a Spirit of Grace and Supplication:</hi> Now 'tis but dropt out upon the Saints, then it ſhall be poured out. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>anointed with the Oyl of Gladneſs above his Fellows;</hi> ſo the Saints ſhall be anointed with the Oyl of Gladneſs above their Fore-Fathers, with the Oyl of Grace and Gladneſs above them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thus ſhall they be fed with the Heritage of <hi>Jacob</hi> their Father.</p>
            <p>What is that?</p>
            <p n="1">1. God himſelf was <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Heritage, as he ſaid to <hi>Abraham,</hi> he would be his <hi>exceeding great Reward:</hi> ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. <hi>I will be with them, and

Jacob</hi> had an Inheritance, <hi>viz. Canaan,</hi> but there were times when he was not fed with his Heritage; as 1. when he fled from his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eſau,</hi> who threatned to be avenged on him, and to kill him: then he was forc'd from his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, and not fed with it: and 2: When there was a Famine in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> then his Heritage failed him, and he went down into <hi>Egypt</hi> to be fed there. But there ſhall be a time when the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God ſhall not only <hi>have, but be fed with their Heritage,</hi> their Heritage ſhall not fail them. There is no Famine of Bread in

            <p>THe words are a ſtrong and forcible argument to hold Men back from doing that which they are very prone to, that is, to judge one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. There was a great deal of diſſention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Believers that <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to, about the uſe of things in themſelves indifferent; as Meats, and obſervation of Days; the occaſion was the inequality of Believers; ſome converted from Gentiliſm, Strangers from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> did live in a freer uſe of time and meats, not obſerving the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Feaſts; not tying themſelves to the uſe of meats that the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſtinted to under the Law. Others that were <hi>Jews,</hi> and were called, and embraced the Faith of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:96826:169"/> 
               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> being weak in Faith, did not underſtand that the Legal Ceremonies were abrogated by the coming of <hi>Christ;</hi> ſo out of reverence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Law, did abſtain from meats therein prohibited, and did obſerve Faſts and Feaſts therein enjoyned. The believing <hi>Jew</hi> now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned the believing <hi>Gentile</hi> as a contemner of the Law: on the other ſide, the believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> did condemn the <hi>Jews</hi> for their Judaizing, and walking contrary to the liberty of the Goſpel: and the difference grew to ſuch a height as that each ſide ſeems to condemn the other, as not having a part in <hi>Christ.</hi> Now this proud con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of each other the Apoſtle ſtrikes at, and labours to bring them down to a more charitable opinion and loving carriage one towards another. <hi>We ſhall all ſtand before the Judgment Seat of</hi> Chriſt. For us to Judge, is to place our ſelves in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Throne, to which we ſhall be all cited by ſound of the Trumpet and voice of the Arch-angel, and there appear to receive a Sentence ſuitable to what we were in the body. We are to be all Judged by <hi>Christ,</hi> ſo be not Judges of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The words hold forth the laſt and moſt glorious part of the Adminiſtration of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Kingdom: Hitherto you have heard only of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ruling in the midſt of his Enemies, over his Church in the midſt of Enemies, or mingled with wicked; <hi>i. e.</hi> Enemies not at all ſubdued and made his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool: but at the laſt day he ſhall ſit in a Seat and Throne above his Enemies, which are at his left hand to be curſed; and his Church come out from the midſt of Enemies ſtanding on his right hand to be bleſſed.</p>
            <pb n="319" facs="tcp:96826:169"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 1. There is a Judgment-ſeat prepared for <hi>Christ,</hi> on which he ſhall ſit at the laſt day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All Men ſhall ſtand and appear before his Judgment Seat, to receive a Sentence out of his Mouth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath a Judgment Seat prepared. <hi>Jude.</hi> 14. <hi>Math.</hi> 25.31. <hi>He ſhall ſit on the Throne of his Glory;</hi> that is, he ſhall not appear in the form of a Servant, as when he came firſt in the Fleſh, and was deſpiſed; but ln the form of the Son of God, made Judge, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.31. <hi>He will Judge the World by the Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus: he ſhall be Judge not only as God, but as Man, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>We muſt till appear before the Judgment Seat of</hi> Chriſt. <hi>After Death comes Judgment, Heb.</hi> 9.27. Judgment ſhall come, that is by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s coming to Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What is meant by Judgment Seat? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be underſtood properly of a material Throne, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> as Man ſhall ſit on, as Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Judges uſe to ſit?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That which may make for the clearing of this, conſider in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall deſcend from Heaven: in that nature which aſcended, he ſhall deſcend: He was in the World, and ſhall come into the World again, as ſaid the Angel, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.11. <hi>This ſame</hi> Jeſus <hi>which was taken up from you into Heaven, ſhall ſo come,</hi> &amp;c. that is, locally and in the ſame body; thus ſaid <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, <hi>I will come again, and receive you to my ſelf, Joh.</hi> 14.3. And <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.16. <hi>The Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend, and Saints ſhall meet him in the Air:</hi> as he that aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the ſame that deſcended into the lower
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:96826:170"/> parts, that is, the Grave, ſo the ſame ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend again. He deſcended firſt by vertue of a Sentence pronounced againſt him; next he ſhall deſcend to give Sentence againſt thoſe that were againſt him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall viſibly appear in the World, he ſhall not hide himſelf as he did many times at his firſt coming, but to be ſeen, Men ſhall ſee their Judge, <hi>Zach</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall look upon me.</hi> Rev. 1.7. <hi>Every Eye ſhall ſee him;</hi> Saints ſhall ſee him in whom they have believed, Sinners ſhall ſee him whom they pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſecuted and deſpiſed. It was <hi>Job's</hi> Comfort and Confidence; <hi>I ſhall ſee my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, he ſhall ſtand the latter day on Earth:</hi> It ſeems he then comes further than the Air: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saints ſee, but Sinners. <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.17. <hi>Balaam</hi> ſaid, <hi>I ſhall ſee him, but not nigh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſhall appear gloriouſly. A Judgment ſeat is an honourable Place. Judges ſit in their Robes in the Seat of Juſtice: So <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall be ſeen in his Glory. <hi>Math.</hi> 24.30. <hi>with Power and Glory:</hi> that is a viſible brightneſs and fulgor, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.31. <hi>in his Glory;</hi> the Glory of the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> that becomes ſuch a Perſon: what this Glory is, we can't yet know, but ſhall when we ſee him. <hi>Math.</hi> 24.30. <hi>The Sign of the Son of Man ſhall appear in Heaven,</hi> that is, as ſome exceeding Glory and Majeſty in Heaven, which ſhall bear witneſs, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Lord of Heaven and Earth draweth near to Judge the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In the Glory of the Father, Math.</hi> 16.27. that is, ſuch Glory as declares him to be God equal with the Father, which the <hi>Jews</hi> denied;
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:96826:170"/> and then ſhall ſee it ſhall declare him to be an Infinite Perſon. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>He is the Expreſs Image of his Father's Perſon and brightneſs of his Glory.</hi> And as he is, ſo he ſhall be ſeen at that day. God ſhall be ſeen in <hi>Chriſt</hi> as he is in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead in <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s humane nature ſhall ſhine forth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. With innumerable companies of Angels, who ſhall be his Miniſters in gathering the Elect. He hath glorious Attendants, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.31. <hi>He ſhall come, and all the Holy Angels.</hi> Now he hath but a few Poor Men of the World to attend him: his followers are eſteem'd as himſelf in the days of his humiliation, <hi>Rejected of Men, deſpiſed of the People: Chriſt</hi> chuſes now the weak things of the World, but then all his Angels ſhall come with him, <hi>Jude</hi> 14. <hi>Ten Thouſand of his Saints,</hi> according to <hi>Enoch</hi>'s Prophecy: that is, as 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.5. <hi>The Lord thy God ſhall come, and all his Saints with thee,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in his Saints and admired in them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, in making them of Sinners, Holy: of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, Incorruptible; changing vile bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. At this time he ſhall have ſubdued all his Enemies, he ſhall appear in the Glory of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. This is hinted in that word <hi>Seat;</hi> he ſhall ſit down in his Seat: He appeared to <hi>Stephen</hi> as <hi>ſtanding</hi> at the Right-Hand of God, <hi>Acts.</hi> 7.56. ready for Action, taking his Power, riſing up to ſcatter his Enemies. And to <hi>John</hi> as <hi>Riding on a White Horſe,</hi> going on Conquering and to Conquer, which work he is now about. Then he ſhall ſit on a Seat, having Conquered by his Power, and taken his Enemies, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.21.
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:96826:171"/> 
               <hi>The Beaſt and falſe Prophet were taken;</hi> he ſhall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially proceed againſt them for oppoſing him. As God Creating the World in Six Days, reſted the Seventh, ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> having Conquered the World, ſhall ſit down and reſt from fighting, and ſhall proceed to Judge: for that he ſhall appear in the Glory of a Conqueror.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Of Sin;</hi> by having ſatisfied for it, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the guilt and condemning power as to the Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. he ſhall appear the ſecond time <hi>without Sin:</hi> the meaning is, the firſt time of his appearing in the Fleſh, he came with the guilt and burden of Sins, the Sins of the Elect imputed to him, <hi>then made Sin;</hi> the Lord hath <hi>layed on him the iniquities of us all:</hi> as <hi>Aaron</hi> confeſſed the Sins of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> over the head of the Goat, and ſent him into a Land not inhabited. But the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time he ſhall come <hi>without Sin,</hi> without guilt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Sin's no longer imputed; he being ſent away with Sin imputed, to the Grave, he returns without them, having left them in the Land of forgetfulneſs, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Grave, never to be brought in remembrance againſt Saints, becauſe of the full ſatisfaction he made: ſo that he ſhall appear without Sin: that is, to the Saints a Conqueror of Sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Of the Law.</hi> He was made under the Law, being Lord of the Law, he ſuffered that to try its ſtrength upon him, and the Law wrought wrath, and brought death on him; but by the merit of his obedience overcame: for he being Lord of the Law that ſuffered the Curſe of it, God was more honoured hereby than diſhonoured by the tranſgreſſion of the Law, for which he ſuffered and ſo Conquered the Law.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:96826:171"/>3. <hi>Of Death. O Death where is thy ſting? O Grave where is thy victory?</hi> And <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall appear as Conqueror of Death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.18. <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dead, and am alive for evermore.</hi> He hath the Keys of Death and Hell; he that was dead and layed in the Sepulchre, with a Stone rolled on the mouth of it, and Sepulchre ſealed, he hath Conquered Death, and gotten the Keys: that is, Power to deliver over to, or keep from Hell.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He ſhall appear as Conqueror of wicked Men and evil Angels; Againſt ſuch Men he ſhall pronounce Sentence of everlaſting Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for their oppoſing and not believing in him. As for evil Angels, <hi>Jude</hi> 6. he hath <hi>reſerved the Angels in chains of darkneſs to the Judgment of great day.</hi> As Priſoners are kept in Priſon bound till the Aſſizes come, ſo are they by God's Power, that they cannot eſcape.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. All Men ſhall ſtand and appear before the Judgment-ſeat of <hi>Christ,</hi> to receive a Sentence out of his Mouth ſuitable to what they were, and had done in the Body. <hi>Chriſt ſhall be Judge of all, Heb.</hi> 12.23. <hi>Abraham</hi> called him <hi>the Judge of all the Earth, Gen.</hi> 18.25. in which negative queſtion is implied an affirmative poſition, that God above all others muſt and will do right, becauſe from his Judgment there is no appeal. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42. <hi>Judge of Quick and Dead:</hi> of thoſe who being found alive at his coming ſhall be changed, and and of thoſe which ſhall be raiſed from the dead to come to Judgment, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Chriſt ſhall Judge the Quick and Dead</hi> at his appearing and Kingdom: when his Kingdom ſhall be manifeſt
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:96826:172"/> to all the World, as well as over all the World. Yea the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſhall be Judge of evil Angels, they are not in full torment. <hi>Why art thou come to torment us before the time? Math.</hi> 8.29. All their eaſe and mitigation of torments is that they have a power over the wicked, and rule in them, tempting to Sin; thus revenging themſelves on God, and revenge is ſweet. <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.31. They beſought him much that he would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them to go out into the deep, into Hell.</p>
            <p>For Explication ſhall be ſhewn after what form and manner <hi>Christ</hi> ſhall proceed in Judgment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>All ſhall be cited and called to appear before the Judgment-ſeat of</hi> Chriſt. None ſhall hide himſelf then: the wicked ſhall ſeek to hide in holes of the Rocks, and call on the Mountains to hide them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but thence ſhall they be taken, <hi>Math.</hi> 24.31. He ſhall ſend his Angels with a great ſound of a Trumpet and they ſhall gather his Elect, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.52 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.16. As the people of God were Aſſembled in their Solemn Feaſts and Faſts by the ſound of a Trumpet; and as an Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> the Law was given with a moſt loud and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſound; ſo the Summons of all to Judgment ſhall be ſome ſuch ſound, which is here call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d <hi>the laſt trump.</hi> When it ſhall be, all ſhall know what this ſound means. And thoſe that would not hear the ſound of the Goſpel, nor underſtand what that meant, and called Men to, ſhall know the meaning of the Voice of the <hi>Archangel,</hi> and ſhall hear the ſound of the laſt Trump.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>As all, ſo in this order:</hi> That is, firſt the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſhall be Summoned and Judged, and then
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:96826:172"/> the wicked; this may be gathered from divers places. <hi>Math.</hi> 24.31. he ſhall ſend his Angels, and they ſhall gather the Elect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and 25.34. the King firſt ſpeaks <hi>to them on his Right Hand,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.23. <hi>every Man in his order: firſt</hi> Chriſt, <hi>then they that are Chriſt</hi>'s; <hi>then ſhall he put down all rule,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16. the dead in <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall riſe firſt.</p>
            <p>You may take this Argument for a further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of it. The Godly ſhall be Judges of the wicked. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Do ye not know that the Saints ſhall Judge the World?</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Judge that hath authority to give Sentence; Saints by way of aſtipulation, applauding the equity and righteouſneſs of his Judgment, and in and through <hi>Chriſt</hi> triumphing over the World. Now this dignity affirmed of Saints, argues their being firſt judged, that they have received their Bleſſing. <hi>Ye ſhall ſit on twelve Thrones, Judging the twelve Tribes of</hi> Iſrael. <hi>Math.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe that are called to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Judgment-Seat ſhall be examined, and give account of the things done in the Body, that is, of thoughts, words and works. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. that every one may receive the things done in the body; that is, reward agreeable to their actions whether good or bad.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Godly muſt be brought to an account, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12. <hi>every one of us ſhall give account of himſelf to God,</hi> how he hath behaved himſelf; we muſt anſwer the Judge concerning our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Converſations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> our Thoughts, Faith, all ſhall be enquired into.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="326" facs="tcp:96826:173"/>2. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall take notice of the ſincere and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly works of Saints: whatever proceeds from a pure Heart, good Conſcience and Faith unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, out of a deſire to ſerve the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Math.</hi> 25.35. <hi>I was hungry and ye gave me Meat,</hi> &amp;c. God is not unrighteous to forget your works of Faith and labour of Love, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. which ye have ſhewed towards his name. Shew reſpect and reverence to the name of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. every Man's work ſhall be made manifeſt, for the day ſhall declare it, becauſe it ſhall be revealed by fire; which is in part made good in this Life, by the work of the Holy Ghoſt through the Preaching of the Goſpel; cauſing a diſcerning Light to ſhine, to put a difference betwixt Truth and Error: and this work ſhall be perfected at the day of Judgment, when all Truths ſhall be made manifeſt by the revealing brightneſs of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all errors diſcovered thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether the Sins of the Godly ſhall be at all mentioned, or taken notice of in that great day?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The Sins of the Godly ſhall not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear againſt them for Condemnation, for then they muſt appear againſt the Judge, who took the guilt and puniſhment of their Sins upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: but the Godly ſhall triumph over their Sins, becauſe they ſtand before him that died for them; therefore no fear of Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor to their ſhame; all ſorrow and ſo ſhame done away; therefore if the Sins of the Godly be mentioned, yet this ſhall not make them hang down their Heads with ſhame; they ſhall not do as <hi>Adam,</hi> hide themſelves from their Judge;
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:96826:173"/> theſe things are clear. Now ſome hold that they ſhall not be at all brought to light, becauſe by Sentence of Juſtification they are covered and taken away. To this may be anſwered, that in the time of this Life, Believers are abſolved in God's gracious ſentence towards them, and in their own conſcience, more privately and ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the witneſs of the Spirit; but at the day of Judgment they ſhall be abſolved and acquitted of all Sins more publickly, even in the ſight of Angels, and the whole World: Now the Spirit ſpeaks to the Heart and Conſcience, <hi>then Chriſt</hi> ſhall openly pronounce Sentence, <hi>Come ye Bleſſed of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. therefore it ſeems not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the analogy of Faith, to hold that the Sins of the Godly ſhall be brought to light. Nay it ſeems very ſuitable to the great deſign of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which is to illuſtrate and commend in the higheſt manner the free Grace of God, the great love of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the power of his Death, and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Vertue of his Sacrifice. As that day is a day of Wrath to the Wicked, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo a day of Love to the Saints, wherein the Love of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall in the fulneſs of it be diſplay'd; and to commend it the more, it ſeems not incongruous to affirm that the Sins of the Godly ſhall be brought to light; even their ſecret Sins. <hi>He ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and admired in them that believe;</hi> his great love to Saints ſhall cauſe great admiration; that is, they ſhall admire the love of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> not only to themſelves, but other Saints; and Angels ſhall admire <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Saints: now the knowledge of Sin, and of free Grace rejoycing over it, or of the love of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. this ſhall

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:96826:177"/> you have made your peace, there is none to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s wrath, for this is dreadful wrath: The time of this Life is the day of wicked Men's wrath, of <hi>Satan's</hi> wrath againſt the Godly, now they breath out threatnings; but the comfort is, their wrath ſhall turn to the praiſe of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wicked Men's wrath ſhall work for the good of Saints, therein the power and wiſdom of God hath praiſe; but the laſt day is a day of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s wrath againſt the wicked; and 'tis true this wrath ſhall turn to the praiſe of God, but who is there to reſtrain his wrath? To be under the wrath of Man or <hi>Satan</hi> is a moſt miſerable conditon, if there be none to reſtrain it; but worſe under <hi>Christ</hi>'s wrath.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All ſinful works ſhall be remembred, and brought in upon an inditement againſt them, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he at that day, whoſe iniquity is forgiven, and ſin covered; that hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> for his Righteouſneſs, and Faith to put him on.

And ſo under theſe great ſins and injuries done to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> all others are included: <hi>I was hungry,</hi> &amp;c. and theſe ſhall go away <hi>into everlaſting puniſhment:</hi> and in the upſhot theſe were injuries done to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which he makes his own injuries by Compaſſion, as the Head ſuffers when the Members ſuffer: this you reckon a ſmall matter, to paſs by a Member of <hi>Christ,</hi> and not ſupply his wants; and if ſo for not feeding <hi>Christ</hi> in his Members how much more for going about to ſtarve <hi>Christ</hi> in his Members, by taking away the Bread of Life from them; if for not viſiting when ſick and in priſon, how much more for wounding of Saints in Name, Body, Eſtates, and for caſting of Saints into priſon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. No works of theirs which for matter are good, ſhall be remembred and accepted of in that day; every work being weighed in the Ballance, like <hi>Belſhazzar</hi> being found too light: whatever proceeds not from Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor is done out of zeal to the Glory of God, ſhall be found too light: and for wicked Men's works, as hearing the Word, doing Juſtice, giving Almes, they ſhall not plead any thing for you; your Holy things ſhall not plead againſt iniquity, becauſe there is
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:96826:178"/> iniquity in your holy things: ſelf-love; ſeeking Men's praiſe; no ſincere love to the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> no judging <hi>Christ</hi> worthy of obedience. If you do a good turn to a Man for your own ends, what thanks do you deſerve? For know, whatever good you do, if it proceed not from a pure heart, a good Conſcience towards God, Faith in the Lord <hi>Jeſus, &amp;c.</hi> it ſhall be reckoned but among your ſins, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.21. <hi>Not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord,</hi> that in words will call <hi>Chriſt Lord,</hi> but deny it in works, ſhall enter into Heaven; ſhall be judged meet for that Kingdom: <hi>But he that doth the will of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> 'Tis not enough to do what is good, but to do it as the will of the Father, out of obedience to his command, with an aim at his honour: yet that's not all; but <hi>he that doth the will of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that obeys the will of the Father as he is <hi>Chriſt's Father,</hi> knowing the Son as the Father, doing the will of the Father for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake, coming to the Father through the Son, moved with love to <hi>Christ,</hi> he ſhall enter Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Objection.</hi> But is this neceſſary, will ſome plead at the laſt day, that the will of the Father, of <hi>thy Father, as thy Father</hi> muſt be done? Is it for thy ſake? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Why, that we can plead, Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord, have we not Prophecied in thy Name? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall ſay, <hi>Depart from me, I never knew you,</hi> I never knew you Born again, Converted, made new Creatures. I never ſaw you deny your ſelves out of ſincere love to me, and zeal of my honour, I never ſaw you in my Kingdom of Grace, ſo I will not now admit you to any fellowſhip or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with me: Depart, <hi>ye workers of Iniquity,</hi> whatever you have done, I look on you but as
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:96826:178"/> workers of iniquity; your good works that you plead, I reckon but amongſt your ſins. How ſad a time will it be then with Wicked Men, who ſhall ſay, is our Religion vain? Shall none of our works and doings proffit? Have we prayed and taken ſo much pains from time to time, <hi>Sabbath</hi> after <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and all in vain? will God forget all? what a miſerable caſe are we then in? Even ſo it ſhall be, nothing remembred, if you are not regenerated, if not a new Creature, if you have not true Faith in the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> reſting in him alone for Salvation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When their ſinful works ſhall be ſet before them, in order and imperfection of their good works ſhewn, then the wicked ſhall be convinced of both in their own Conſciences: now Wicked Men will not be convinced of ſin, nor judge aright of their performances, <hi>they are paſt feeling, Eph.</hi> 4.19. The Greek word ſignifies, <hi>them that having done any thing amiſs can't grieve,</hi> or take ſhame to themſelves, as Drunkards paſt feeling, Swearers paſt feeling, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Having the Conſcience ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a hot Iron:</hi> That is, either profeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the people of God, their Conſciences are ſtigmatized with the works of many foul and enormous crimes; a metaphor taken from Rogues who are burnt in the Hand, or ſome other part of the body: or Conſcience ſo inſenſible of ſin and their dangerous eſtate by it, and of the fearful Judgments of God, as dead and hard Fleſh feared with a hot Iron. Thus 'tis for the moſt part with wicked Men here, but when they are called to Judgment, then their Conſcience ſhall recover feeling, then it ſhall do its office in accuſing, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:

Here when the Spirit of God in the word ſtrives with Sinners to convince of ſin, and would diſcover their damnable eſtate. They have ſomewhat to ſay,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:96826:179"/> that as they ſin, ſo they do ſomewhat that is good or will repent hereafter, or will repent before they dye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but then they are all ſpeechleſs and paſt excuſes.</p>
